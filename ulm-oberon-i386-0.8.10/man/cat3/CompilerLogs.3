[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mCompilerLogs[24m provides a filter and formatting tool for logs about load-
       ing and compilation processes. Filtering and formatting depends on  two
       state variables belonging to each log:

       ·      The  log  level  is the amount of detail that is requested.  The
              minimal level is 0 (no log at all is to be given).   Larger  log
              levels  may  be  given to ask for more detailed informations.  A
              log level of -1 means that all  informations  are  to  be  given
              without restrictions.

       ·      The  nesting level depends on the current nesting of the loading
              and compilation process.  Nesting levels are not limited due  to
              the recursive nature of compilation and loading processes.

       [4mCreate[24m  creates  a log that emits its output onto [4ms[24m.  The output stream
       should be line buffered to avoid any delays in seeing log messages.

   [1mGenerating Logs[0m
       Log messages by the compiler or loader are created using [4mOpen[24m. The  log
       level  of a log message must be positive and [4mOpen[24m returns [1mFALSE [22mif this
       message is to be suppressed by the current filtering  rules.   No  more
       than  one log message stream returned by [4mOpen[24m for a particular log must
       be open at any time to avoid mixups of different log messages.

       The current nesting level is increased by [4mEnterLevel[24m and  decreased  by
       [4mLeaveLevel[24m.  To assure proper nesting a key must be given to [4mLeaveLevel[0m
       that was previously returned by [4mEnterLevel[24m.

   [1mFiltering Logs[0m
       [4mSetLogLevel[24m allows to set the current log level. All log messages  with
       a  log  level larger than [4mmaxlevel[24m will be suppressed.  A [4mmaxlevel[24m of [1m0[0m
       causes all messages to be dropped, a [4mmaxlevel[24m of [1m-1 [22masks for  all  mes-
       sages regardless of their log level.

       [4mSetMaximalNestLevel[24m  requests  all log messages to be suppressed with a
       nesting level larger than [4mmaxnestlevel[24m. A [4mmaxnestlevel[24m  of  [1m-1  [22mremoves
       restrictions regarding the nest level. This is the default setting.

       By default, [4mCompilerLogs[24m intends its output according to the nest level
       of the individual log messages. [4mFlatten[24m suppresses any indentation  and
       sets the maximal nesting level to [1m-1 [22m(unrestricted).

       [4mLogLevel[24m  and  [4mNestLevel[24m  return  the  current  log  and nesting level,
       respectively.

[1mDIAGNOSTICS[0m
       [4mCompilerLogs[24m does not generate any error events on its own.

[1mSEE ALSO[0m
       [4mobload(1)[24m           command line  interface  for  [4mObjectLoader(3)[24m  that
                           allows a log level to be specified.
       [4mCompilerErrors(3)[24m   standardized events for compilation errors that are
                           usually not distributed by logs.
       [4mObjectLoader(3)[24m     general object loader for compiler databases,  cur-
                           rently the main source of log messages from loading
                           processes.
