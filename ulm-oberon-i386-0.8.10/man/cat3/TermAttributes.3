       _T_e_r_m_A_t_t_r_i_b_u_t_e_s adds support of display attributes on ASCII
       terminals.  Display attributes are used on character-based
       displays to highlight selected characters when they appear
       on  the  screen.  More than one attribute can be active at
       the same time. Following attributes are supported  by  the
       abstraction:

       _s_t_a_n_d_o_u_t   standout mode is the standard mode to highlight
                  selected characters. On many terminals  it's  a
                  combination   of  one  or  more  of  the  other
                  attributes.
       _u_n_d_e_r_l_i_n_e  underline character
       _r_e_v_e_r_s_e    reverse fore- and background colour of  charac­
                  ter

       _b_l_i_n_k      make character blink at a certain frequency
       _d_i_m        draw character with less intensity
       _b_o_l_d       draw character bold or with more intensity

       _I_n_i_t has to be called by the underlying terminal implemen­
       tation with the interface specified by _i_f and  the  avail­
       able attributes in _s_e_t.

       _S_e_t makes _a_t_t_r_i_b_u_t_e_s the active set.

       _C_u_r_r_e_n_t returns the set of attributes currently in use.

       _A_v_a_i_l_a_b_l_e returns the set of available attributes.

       Errors  are  converted  to  events of type _e_r_r_o_r which are
       passed to _R_e_l_a_t_e_d_E_v_e_n_t_s for  further  handling.  Following
       errorcodes are currently implemented:

       _u_n_k_n_o_w_n_A_t_t_r_i_b_u_t_e   an  attribute to be set with _S_e_t is not
                          supported by the terminal.
       _n_o_t_S_u_p_p_o_r_t_e_d       the   terminal   does    not    support
                          attributes.
