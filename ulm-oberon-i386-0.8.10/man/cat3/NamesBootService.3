[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mNamesBootService[24m  defines  a  simple  service based upon [4mDaemons(3)[24m and
       [4mRemoteObjects(3)[24m that provides the address of a root node  at  a  known
       address.  This  is mainly used to import the public root from an Oberon
       name service, see [4mNames(3)[24m.

       [4mExport[24m makes [4mroot[24m at [4maddress[24m available.

       [4mImport[24m attempts to import a node from [4maddress[24m  and  to  store  it  into
       [4mroot[24m.

[1mDIAGNOSTICS[0m
       The error events of the underlying modules are propagated to [4merrors[24m.

[1mSEE ALSO[0m
       [4mIPv4NameSystems(3)[24m   is  based  upon  [4mNamesBootService[24m and imports root
                            nodes from IPv4 addresses.
       [4mUnixNames(3)[24m         attempts to find an Oberon  name  service  and  to
                            import its root object using [4mIPv4NameSystems(3)[24m.
