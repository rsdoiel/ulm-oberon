       _T_e_r_m_L_i_n_e_G_r_a_p_h_i_c_s adds basic line drawing  capabilities  to
       ASCII terminals. Terminals that support line graphics usu­
       ally provide an alternate character set for graphics char­
       acters.  _T_e_r_m_L_i_n_e_G_r_a_p_h_i_c_s  uses  only  a subset of all the
       graphics characters that may be supported by a  particular
       terminal.   The information for a specific character, i.e.
       the character set it belongs to and  it's  ASCII-code,  is
       stored in a record of type _G_r_a_p_h_i_c_s_C_h_a_r.

       _I_n_i_t has to be called by the underlying terminal implemen­
       tation with the set of graphics characters in _c_h_a_r_s_e_t  and
       a procedure for changing character sets in _s_e_t_C_h_a_r_s_e_t.  If
       _I_n_i_t was not called, _T_e_r_m_L_i_n_e_G_r_a_p_h_i_c_s uses a  default  set
       of non-graphics characters for drawing.

       _D_r_a_w draws a single graphics character.

       _H_L_i_n_e draws a horizontal line.

       _V_L_i_n_e draws a vertical line.

       _B_o_x draws a rectangle.

       The  drawing procedures do not test for valid screen coor­
       dinates.
