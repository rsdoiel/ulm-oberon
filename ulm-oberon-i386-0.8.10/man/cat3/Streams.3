[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [4mStreams[24m module defines an extensible abstraction for byte oriented
       I/O-operations and implements an efficient buffering mechanism.

       A stream is  a  data  structure  which  references  two  components:  a
       sequence  of  bytes  and  a  position.   Each byte of a sequence has an
       address: the first byte of a stream has address 0, the second  byte  1,
       etc.  The current position is the address of the byte to be affected by
       the next read or write operation.  Thus the current position cannot  be
       negative.  Read and write requests cause the position to advance by the
       returned byte count which is less or  equal  to  the  requested  count.
       Failures  of  read or write operations (count value equals zero) do not
       modify the current position.

       The length of a stream is defined to be the highest byte  address  plus
       one.  The length is infinite if the highest byte address is not defined
       (in case of infinite streams).  In normal case a  current  position  is
       valid  if  and  only if it ranges from 0 to the stream length.  Streams
       with holes may invalidate positions within this range  or  allow  posi-
       tions beyond the stream length.

       Bidirectional  streams  reference  a  communication  channel and do not
       maintain a current position.  Instead, reading a character  removes  it
       from  the  input queue and writing a character appends it to the output
       queue.  Streams are bidirectional if they support read and write opera-
       tions but neither seek nor tell operations.

       An  interface  defines  a  set of procedures which implement a [4mStreams[24m-
       abstraction for a specific form of  input  and/or  output.   Not  every
       interface  procedure  needs  to be implemented.  The set of implemented
       procedures is given by the [4mcaps[24m parameter of [4mInit[24m.  At  least  [4mread[24m  or
       [4mwrite[24m  must  be provided.  Note that the byte-wise read or write opera-
       tion must always be given even if additional read/write-operations  are
       supported  ([4mbufio[24m or [4maddrio[24m).  All other operations ([4mseek[24m, [4mtell[24m, [4mtrunc[24m,
       [4mclose[24m, and [4mhandler[24m) are optional.  The interface procedures should meet
       following specifications:
       [4mread[24m: [1mPROCEDURE[22m([4ms[24m: [4mStream[24m; [1mVAR [4m[22mbyte[24m: [1mBYTE[22m) : [1mBOOLEAN[22m;
            assign  the byte at the current position to [4mbyte[24m and increment the
            current position by 1.  Return of [1mFALSE [22mindicates read  errors  or
            end of stream.
       [4mwrite[24m: [1mPROCEDURE[22m([4ms[24m: [4mStream[24m; [4mbyte[24m: [1mBYTE[22m) : [1mBOOLEAN[22m;
            replace the byte at the current position by [4mbyte[24m and increment the
            current position by 1.  Return of [1mFALSE [22mindicates write errors.
       [4mseek[24m: [1mPROCEDURE[22m([4ms[24m: [4mStream[24m; [4mcnt[24m: [4mCount[24m; [4mwhence[24m: [4mWhence[24m) : [1mBOOLEAN[22m;
            sets the current position in dependence of [4mwhence[24m and [4mcnt[24m to:
            [4mfromStart[24m   new position at [4mcnt[0m
            [4mfromPos[24m     new position at the current position + [4mcnt[0m
            [4mfromEnd[24m     new position at the length of the stream + [4mcnt[0m
       [4mtell[24m: [1mPROCEDURE[22m([4ms[24m: [4mStream[24m; [1mVAR [4m[22mcount[24m: [4mCount[24m) : [1mBOOLEAN[22m;
            stores the current position into [4mcount[24m.  This operation should not
            fail  in  normal  case.   [4mStreams[24m  calls [4mtell[24m for buffered streams
            after opening.  In case of failures  [4mStreams[24m  assumes  a  starting
            position  of 0.  In normal case [4mStreams[24m keeps track of the current
            position.  This interface procedure is  called  only  in  case  of
            unbuffered  streams,  or  if [4mSeek[24m is called relative to the stream
            length ([4mfromEnd[24m) or if [4mTouch[24m is called.
       [4mflush[24m: [1mPROCEDURE[22m([4ms[24m: [4mStream[24m) : [1mBOOLEAN[22m;
            is called by [4mFlush[24m after  having  performed  the  necessary  write
            operations.  This interface procedure allows the implementation to
            propagate [4mFlush[24m operations to an underlying stream.
       [4mtrunc[24m: [1mPROCEDURE[22m([4ms[24m: [4mStream[24m; [4mcnt[24m: [4mCount[24m) : [1mBOOLEAN[22m;
            truncate the length of the stream to [4mcnt[24m.   Thus  all  bytes  with
            addresses  greater  or  equal to [4mcnt[24m are to be deleted.  This call
            must not modify the current position.
       [4mclose[24m: [1mPROCEDURE[22m([4ms[24m: [4mStream[24m) : [1mBOOLEAN[22m;
            is called by [4mClose[24m and allows  final  cleanup.   Return  of  [1mFALSE[0m
            indicates  errors  on cleanup but does not prevent the stream from
            being closed.
       [4mhandler[24m: [1mPROCEDURE[22m([4ms[24m: [4mStream[24m; [1mVAR [4m[22mmsg[24m: [4mMessage[24m);
            allows the implementation of extended operations which are identi-
            fied and parameterized by extensions of [4mMessage[24m.

       The  interface  procedures  of  type  [4mAddrIOProc[24m  and [4mBufIOProc[24m must be
       equivalent to multiple calls of [4mread[24m or [4mwrite[24m (until the first failure)
       for  buffered  streams.  Positive counts returned by reading procedures
       which are less than the requested count are not interpreted as failure.
       If  necessary,  [4mStreams[24m  repeats  reading until all requested bytes are
       read or a zero count is returned.

       [4mInit[24m initializes the stream [4ms[24m for the interface  specified  by  [4mif[24m  and
       [4mcaps[24m  with buffering mode [4mbufmode[24m.  Note that [4mInit[24m does not allocate [4ms[24m.
       Buffering mode is one of
       [4mnobuf[24m     All operations are translated to  the  appropriate  interface
                 procedures.
       [4monebuf[24m    One  buffer of a system dependent size is allocated to reduce
                 the number of interface procedure calls.
       [4mlinebuf[24m   Like [4monebuf[24m but an automatic flush occurs if a line  termina-
                 tor  is  written  (default 0AX; can be modified by [4mLineTerm[24m).
                 Line buffered streams may be tied together.  In case of  read
                 operations  from line buffered streams the line buffered out-
                 put of the associated stream gets  flushed.   This  buffering
                 mode  is  intended  for  interactive line oriented I/O and is
                 much more efficient than [4mnobuf[24m.
       [4mbufpool[24m   A set of buffers serves as cache of the underlying  implemen-
                 tation.   The  number  of buffers may be retrieved and set by
                 [4mGetBufferPoolSize[24m and [4mSetBufferPoolSize[24m.
       This procedure is called by  modules  which  implement  a  abstraction.
       Normal  user  programs  call open procedures of abstraction implementa-
       tions (e.g. [4mUnixFiles.Open[24m).

       [4mGetBufMode[24m returns the buffering mode associated with [4ms[24m.

       [4mLineTerm[24m allows  to  change  the  line  terminator  for  line  buffered
       streams.  The default line terminator is newline (0AX).

       [4mTie[24m ties the line buffered stream [4min[24m to the stream [4mout[24m, i.e. read oper-
       ations on [4min[24m cause [4mout[24m to  be  flushed.   Bidirectional  line  buffered
       streams  are always tied to themselves, so [4mTie[24m must not be called if [4min[0m
       is equal to [4mout[24m.  Streams may be untied by calling [4mTie[24m with [4mout[24m set  to
       [1mNIL[22m.

       [4mGetBufferPoolSize[24m  and  [4mSetBufferPoolSize[24m  return and set the number of
       buffers.  The number of buffers may only be  modified  if  [4mbufpool[24m  has
       been taken as buffering mode.

       [4mCapabilities[24m returns the capabilities of the given stream.

       [4mGetFlushEvent[24m returns an event type which will be raised [4mbefore[24m execut-
       ing any flush operations (either call [4mFlush[24m or  internal  flush  opera-
       tions).   This  event  type  is  suitable for bidirectional streams and
       allows to empty the input queue before the output queue gets flushed.

       [4mGetCloseEvent[24m returns like [4mGetFlushEvent[24m an event type  which  will  be
       raised  [4mbefore[24m  the  stream  is  shut  by the close operation.  [4mStreams[0m
       assures that this event will be raised with a priority which is greater
       than the current priority (see [4mEvents(3)[24m).  This event type allows some
       final operations to be called.   Note  that  [4mStreams[24m  protects  against
       recursive  calls  of  [4mClose[24m or [4mRelease[24m (in this case a [4mNestedCall[24m error
       would be returned for the first call).

       [4mClose[24m closes [4ms[24m.  The value of [4ms[24m remains unchanged to allow  examination
       of  the  public components (this is useful in case of errors).  [4mRelease[0m
       works like [4mClose[24m but does  not  return  a  [1mBOOLEAN  [22mvalue.   Note  that
       [4mStreams[24m maintains a list of open streams which may need some cleanup on
       termination (i.e. streams which have a close interface procedure or are
       buffered).  These streams are therefore not subject to the garbage col-
       lection as long as [4mClose[24m has not been called for them.

       [4mStreams[24m supports the mechanisms of [4mResources(3)[24m:

       ·      [4mRelease[24m is called automatically for unreferenced streams.

       ·      [4mClose[24m and [4mRelease[24m cause the stream to terminate.

       [4mReadByte[24m  assigns  the  byte  at  the  current  position  to  [4mbyte[24m  and
       increments the current position by one.  [4mReadByte[24m returns [1mFALSE [22min case
       of end of stream (current position equals the stream length) or errors.
       [4mWriteByte[24m  assigns  [4mbyte[24m to the byte at the current position and incre-
       ments the current position by one.  [4mReadByte[24m  and  [4mWriteByte[24m  are  much
       faster than [4mRead[24m and [4mWrite[24m for single bytes.

       [4mReadPart[24m and [4mWritePart[24m allow to read and write parts of [4mbuf[24m: [4moff[24m speci-
       fies the start position and [4mcnt[24m the number of bytes to be read or writ-
       ten.  [4mRead[24m and [4mWrite[24m call [4mReadPart[24m and [4mWritePart[24m with [4moff[24m = 0 and [4mcnt[24m =
       [1mLEN[22m([4mbuf[24m).

       Note that [4mWritePart[24m and [4mWrite[24m take [4mbuf[24m as [1mVAR [22mparameter  to  avoid  the
       overhead  of  an  unnecessary copy.  Neither [4mWritePart[24m nor [4mWrite[24m modify
       [4mbuf[24m. If an arbitrary expression is to be passed, [4mWritePartC[24m and  [4mWriteC[0m
       may be used instead.

       [4mReadPart[24m  tries  to  read  the given number of bytes even when multiple
       calls of the read interface procedure are necessary.  This may  not  be
       appropriate  in cases where the first read operation wouldn't block but
       subsequent ones.  [4mReadPacket[24m returns available input from  the  associ-
       ated buffer or, in case of unbuffered streams or empty buffers, invokes
       one read operation.  [4mmaxcnt[24m specifies the maximal number of bytes to be
       read and [4mReadPart[24m returns the number of bytes actually copied into [4mbuf[24m.

       [4mSeek[24m sets the current position in dependence of [4mwhence[24m and [4mcnt[24m to:
       [4mfromStart[24m   new position at [4mcnt[0m
       [4mfromPos[24m     new position at the current position + [4mcnt[0m
       [4mfromEnd[24m     new position at the length of the stream + [4mcnt[0m
       If [4ms[24m is buffered then the seek-operation is  possibly  delayed  to  the
       next  read  or write operation.  This can result in seek-related errors
       on subsequent read or write operations.

       [4mTell[24m returns the current position.  This position can differ  from  the
       real  position  of  the  underlying  implementation in case of buffered
       streams.  [4mTouch[24m allows to synchronize both positions.

       [4mGetPos[24m and [4mSetPos[24m work like [4mTell[24m and [4mSeek[24m ([4mwhence[24m [1m= [4m[22mfromStart[24m)  without
       returning a [1mBOOLEAN [22mvalue.

       [4mTrunc[24m  truncates  the length of the stream to [4mcnt[24m.  Thus all bytes with
       addresses greater or equal to [4mcnt[24m are deleted.  This call does not mod-
       ify the current position.

       Stream buffering allows to undo read operations.  At least one success-
       ful undo operation is guaranteed.  Further undo operations require seek
       ability.   [4mBack[24m  decrements  the current position by one.  [4mInsert[24m works
       like [4mBack[24m but causes [4mbyte[24m to be returned on next read operation.

       [4mFlush[24m and [4mTouch[24m synchronize buffered streams with the underlying imple-
       mentation.  [4mFlush[24m is useful for output streams and causes the buffer to
       be flushed.  The  current  position  remains  unchanged.   [4mTouch[24m  calls
       [4mFlush[24m, causes any buffer contents to be forgotten, and sets the current
       position to that of the underlying implementation.

       [4mInputInBuffer[24m and [4mOutputInBuffer[24m return [1mTRUE [22mif any bytes are  buffered
       for  reading or writing resp.  [4mOutputWillBeBuffered[24m returns [1mTRUE [22mif the
       next byte passed to one of the writing procedures will be buffered.

       [4mSend[24m passes the given message to the handler associated with [4ms[24m.

       [4mCopy[24m copies from the current position of [4msource[24m to the current position
       of  [4mdest[24m  until  end  of file is reached or [4mmaxcnt[24m bytes are copied (if
       [4mmaxcnt[24m is non-negative).

       Some streams are predefined.  The [4mnull[24m-stream accepts  any  output  and
       returns  read  requests  with zero counts.  The standard streams [4mstdin[24m,
       [4mstdout[24m, and [4mstderr[24m are initialized to [4mnull[24m but are possibly  reinitial-
       ized  by  other modules (e.g. [4mUnixFiles(3)[24m initializes them to the UNIX
       standard files).

[1mDIAGNOSTICS[0m
       Error indications besides success or failure can be read from the  pub-
       lic components of the stream record:
       [4mcount[24m       gives the count of the last read or write operation.
       [4merrors[24m      is incremented for each error.  A typical application is to
                   set [4merrors[24m to 0, then to call some  stream  operations  and
                   finally to check [4merrors[24m for being positive.
       [4merror[24m       represents the success of the last operation.
       [4mlasterror[24m   is set to the error code of the last failure.
       [4meof[24m         is [1mTRUE [22mif read operations return zero counts.

       Note  that  [4mRead[24m,  [4mReadPart[24m,  [4mWrite[24m,  [4mWritePart[24m, [4mWriteC[24m, and [4mWritePartC[0m
       return [1mTRUE [22monly if they were able to read or write the full amount  of
       bytes  as requested.  In case of partial read or writes, the [4mcount[24m com-
       ponent tells how many bytes were actually read or written.

       Following error codes are currently implemented:
       [4mNoHandlerDefined[24m   [4mSend[24m was called but no handler is defined.
       [4mNotLineBuffered[24m    [4mLineTerm[24m must not be called for  streams  which  are
                          not line buffered.
       [4mUnbuffered[24m         Operation must not be called for unbuffered streams,
                          e.g. [4mBack[24m or [4mInsert[24m.
       [4mBadParameters[24m      Bad parameter values, e.g. wrong counts or  offsets.
       [4mWriteFailed[24m        write  error:  less  bytes  than requested have been
                          written.
       [4mCannotWrite[24m        stream is read-only.
       [4mReadFailed[24m         read error: less  bytes  than  requested  have  been
                          read.
       [4mCannotRead[24m         stream is write-only.
       [4mSeekFailed[24m         failed  seek  operation:  e.g.  seek  beyond  stream
                          length.
       [4mCannotSeek[24m         stream is not capable of seeking.
       [4mBadWhence[24m          [4mwhence[24m value is outside of [[4mfromStart[24m..[4mfromEnd[24m].
       [4mTellFailed[24m         tell operation failed.
       [4mCannotTell[24m         the underlying implementation does  not  maintain  a
                          current position.
       [4mCannotTrunc[24m        stream is not capable of truncating.
       [4mTruncFailed[24m        trunc  operation  failed,  e.g.  current position is
                          beyond the given length.
       [4mCloseFailed[24m        close operation  of  the  underlying  implementation
                          ended with errors.
       [4mNestedCall[24m         the given stream is locked.
       [4mFlushFailed[24m        flush operation failed.

       Valid  error  numbers range from 0 to [4merrorcodes[24m-1.  The array [4merrormsg[0m
       contains readable error messages for all valid error numbers.

       All stream related errors lead to events of type [4merror[24m which are passed
       to  [4mRelatedEvents(3)[24m  for  further  handling.  Modules calling [4mInit[24m are
       expected to decide whether stream related events are to be queued or to
       be  forwarded  to another object.  By default, events of type [4merror[24m are
       ignored.

       An assertion of [4mInit[24m fails in case of invalid  interfaces  (e.g.  empty
       set of capabilities).
