[1mNAME[0m
       PipeReaders - read and buffer input from pipelines

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       PROCEDURE Spawn(VAR s: Streams.Stream; pipe: Streams.Stream);


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mPipeReaders[24m  provides  a  [4mStreams(3)[24m  implementation  that continuously
       reads all available input from a given stream, buffers it, and makes it
       available  as  soon  as  it is convenient to process it. This allows to
       avoid deadlocks in case where the producer could get suspended  because
       its output is not consumed.

       This  module  preserves  the  input packets (see [4mStreams.ReadPacket[24m) as
       long their size does not exceed the internal buffer size.  [4mStreamCondi-[0m
       [4mtions(3)[24m is supported.

       [4mSpawn[24m spawns off a task that reads from [4mpipe[24m and makes its input avail-
       able through [4ms[24m. This task will run until [4ms[24m is closed.


[1mDIAGNOSTICS[0m
       Error events are forwarded from [4mpipe[24m to [4ms[24m.

[1mSEE ALSO[0m
       [4mUnixPipes(3)[24m   create pipelines to other processes
