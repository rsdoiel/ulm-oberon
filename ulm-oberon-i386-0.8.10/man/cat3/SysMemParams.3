       SysMemParams - system-dependent constants for [4mSysStorage(3)[0m

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       On SPARC processors:

       CONST minAlignment = 8;


       On I386 processors:

       CONST minAlignment = 4;


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mSysMemParams[24m provides all system-dependent constants that allow to keep
       [4mSysStorage(3)[24m portable:

       [4mminAlignment[24m   specifies the minimal alignment  that  is  required  for
                      allocated  areas  for unknown types. This is the maximum
                      of all minimal alignments of all Oberon type representa-
                      tions.
