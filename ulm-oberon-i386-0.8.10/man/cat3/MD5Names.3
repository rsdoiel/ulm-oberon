[1mNAME[0m
       MD5Names - create names that are derived from MD5 digests

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       PROCEDURE Create(VAR name: ConstStrings.String; s: Streams.Stream);


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mCreate[24m  reads  the  entire stream [4ms[24m beginning from position 0, computes
       the MD5 digest for it (using [4mMD5(3)[24m) and converts its printable  repre-
       sentation  (in  hex)  into  a constant string that is stored into [4mname[24m.
       This is mainly useful to generate unique names (see [4mNames(3)[24m) that ref-
       erence text streams.
