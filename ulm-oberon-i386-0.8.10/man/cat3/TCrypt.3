       _T_C_r_y_p_t provides an implementation of a special public  key
       system  called  TCRYPT. The algorithm was created by Prof.
       R. Trautner of the University of Ulm.

       _C_r_e_a_t_e creates a cipher _k_e_y for the TCRYPT public key sys­
       tem.   This cipher differs in some manners from usual pub­
       lic key ciphers as it's composed function is not the iden­
       tity map.
