       _T_i_m_e_r_s  maintains  multiple  timers  for  each clock.  _A_d_d
       causes _e_v_e_n_t to be raised at  the  given  time.   Relative
       time  measures  are taken relative to the current time.  A
       reference to the timer is returned to allow the  timer  to
       be  removed  by  _R_e_m_o_v_e.  _S_c_h_e_d_u_l_e works like _A_d_d but does
       not return a reference to the timer.

       _N_e_x_t_E_v_e_n_t returns the time of the next event in the  queue
       of timers.

       Errors are related to the given clock and passed to _R_e_l_a_t_­
       _e_d_E_v_e_n_t_s:
       _i_n_v_a_l_i_d_T_i_m_e_r   An  invalid  timer  was  given  to  _R_e_m_o_v_e.
                      Timers  become  invalid  if  they have been
                      dispatched or removed.
       _q_u_e_u_e_L_o_c_k_e_d    The timer queue of the clock  is  currently
                      locked.
       _b_a_d_C_l_o_c_k       The  given  clock  is  unable to maintain a
                      timer.
