       UnixHost - retrieve name and address of the current host

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       PROCEDURE GetHostName(VAR hostname: ARRAY OF CHAR);
       PROCEDURE GetDomainName(VAR domain: ARRAY OF CHAR);
       PROCEDURE GetFullyQualifiedHostName(VAR name: ARRAY OF CHAR);

       PROCEDURE GetLocalIPv4Address(VAR ipaddr: IPv4Addresses.Address) : BOOLEAN;
       PROCEDURE GetLocalIPv6Address(VAR ipaddr: IPv6Addresses.Address) : BOOLEAN;


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mUnixHost[24m  attempts  to  find and verify the host and domain name of the
       current host and the corresponding IP addresses using some system calls
       and the DNS system.

       [4mGetHostName[24m  returns  the  non-qualified  hostname of the current host.
       Firstly,  [4mSysUname.GetNodeName[24m  is   tried,   and,   if   this   fails,
       [4mSysHost.GetHostName[24m. If the hostname returned by either of these system
       calls includes a domain name, it is stripped off.

       [4mGetDomainName[24m uses  [4mGetFullyQualifiedHostName[24m  to  retrieve  the  fully
       qualified domain name and remove its host part.

       [4mGetFullyQualifiedHostName[24m  attempts to return the fully qualified host-
       name of the current host for which DNS address records exists to  which
       local  sockets can be bound to. It starts with the hostname returned by
       [4mGetHostName[24m and attempts to  retrieve  address  records  for  it  using
       [4mDNSResolvers(3)[24m.   If  this fails, the environment variable [1mLOCALDOMAIN[0m
       is checked for and, if defined, combined with the unqualified  hostname
       to retrieve DNS address records. If this fails as well, a final attempt
       is made using the domain name returned by [4mSysHost.GetDomainName[24m.

       [4mGetLocalIPv4Address[24m and [4mGetLocalIPv6Address[24m return one of  the  address
       records  that  are  defined for the hostname returned by [4mGetFullyQuali-[0m
       [4mfiedHostName[24m.  They return [1mFALSE [22mif  no  such  addresses  exists.   The
       selection is non-deterministic if multiple addresses exist.

[1mENVIRONMENT[0m
       [4mLOCALDOMAIN[24m   is,  if  provided, one of the candidates for domain names
                     that are tested by [4mGetFullyQualifiedHostName[0m

[1mSEE ALSO[0m
       [4mSysHost(3)[24m    system calls [4mgethostname(2)[24m and [4mgetdomainname(2)[0m
       [4mSysUname(3)[24m   system call [4muname(2)[24m which includes a node name

[1mBUGS[0m
       On machines that are connected to external and private  networks,  [4mGet-[0m
       [4mFullyQualifiedHostName[24m is unable to ensure that the external network is
       picked out. If different domains are used, it is helpful to enforce the
       correct  selection  by  setting  the  environment  variable [1mLOCALDOMAIN[0m
       appropriately.
