[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mRemoteObjects[24m  allows  to  operate  on  remote objects as if they would
       reside locally.  Additionally, [4mRemoteObjects[24m supports the operations of
       [4mPersistentDisciplines(3)[24m.   Remote  objects  are represented locally by
       proxy objects which forward all operations to the original object.

       Delegation to remote objects is possible by converting operations  into
       persistent  messages,  delivering  them  over a network connection (see
       [4mNetworks(3)[24m), and by converting them back into operations by a  message
       handler  (see  [4mMessages(3)[24m).   The  abstraction-specific  conversion of
       operations into messages and vice versa is done by  type-specific  mod-
       ules  which offer the ``RemoteObjects'' service for this type (see [4mSer-[0m
       [4mvices(3)[24m).  Note that these service providers are pure add-ons  --  the
       original  module which represents the abstraction needs not to be modi-
       fied or adapted to allow a distributed use of it.

   [1mSupporting a type for distribution[0m
       Modules which provide a ``RemoteObjects'' service for a  specific  type
       have  to register themselves during their initialization time by [4mRegis-[0m
       [4mter[24m which calls [4mServices.Define[24m for them.  Note that the  service  does
       not  only  cover  [4mtype[24m  but all extensions thereof if not overridden by
       more specific service offers (see [4mServices(3)[24m for details).

       The access mode determines whether remote calls are to be serialized or
       not.   Note  that  even in serial mode there may be parallel calls (one
       from [4mRemoteObjects[24m and at least one locally).  Thus, serialization  is,
       if   necessary,  always  in  the  responsibility  of  the  abstraction.
       Semaphores (see [4mSemaphores(3)[24m and [4mLocalSemaphores(3)[24m)  are  recommended
       for  critical  regions  which  may  be  entered by one party only.  The
       serial access mode, however, is much more efficient than  the  parallel
       access  mode  if  all  operations have to be serialized anyway.  Conse-
       quently, the parallel access mode is useful only, if there are no crit-
       ical  regions,  or  if they are not always entered, or if they are only
       entered for short time during a longer operation.

       The interface [4mif[24m is expected to meet following specification:
       [4mgetParams[24m: [1mPROCEDURE[22m([4mobject[24m: [4mServices.Object[24m; [1mVAR [4m[22mparams[24m: [4mPersistentOb-[0m
            [4mjects.Object[24m; [1mVAR [4m[22mmode[24m: [4mExportMode[24m);
            this  interface  procedure is, if provided, called if an object is
            exported for the first time.  The to be returned persistent param-
            eter  object  which  may be [1mNIL [22mis later passed to the [4mcreateProxy[0m
            interface procedure on the importing side.  The exporting mode  is
            usually [4mlinked[24m.  That means that proxy objects are later linked to
            the original object.  In case of [4mstandalone[24m, no active  connection
            will be maintained, i.e. objects created later by [4mcreateProxy[24m can-
            not delegate operations to the original object.   An  example  for
            this technique is [4mRemoteIterators(3)[24m which (in some cases) returns
            in [4mparams[24m all informations which are later  necessary  to  perform
            all  operations on the client side.  Note that this interface pro-
            cedure is optional and may therefore be set to [1mNIL[22m.  In this case,
            [1mNIL [22mwill be passed later to [4mcreateProxy[24m.
       [4mcreateProxy[24m:  [1mPROCEDURE[22m([1mVAR [4m[22mobject[24m: [4mServices.Object[24m; [4mparams[24m: [4mPersisten-[0m
            [4mtObjects.Object[24m);
            create a proxy object on the client side in dependence  of  [4mparams[0m
            which  has  been  earlier returned by [4mgetParams[24m.  Note that [4mparams[0m
            may be [1mNIL[22m.  Usually, proxy objects should be an extension of  the
            [4mtype[24m which has been passed to [4mRegister[24m.  This extension should (in
            case of an [4mlinked[24m export mode) implement  all  operations  of  the
            abstraction  of  [4mtype[24m  and  convert  them  into messages (see [4mMes-[0m
            [4msages(3)[24m) which are to be sent to itself.  [4mRemoteObjects[24m  installs
            a  message  handler  for proxy objects which forwards all messages
            over the network connection to the  original  object.   Note  that
            [4mRemoteObjects[24m  guarantees that the returned message is of the same
            type as the sent message.
       [4mregister[24m: [1mPROCEDURE[22m([4mobject[24m: [4mServices.Object[24m);
            this interface procedure is, if provided, called if  the  creation
            of  a  proxy object is completed.  This allows to invoke some ini-
            tial operations on the proxy object (e.g. to  register  itself  at
            the original object).  It may be wise to block other operations as
            long as the registration is not finished by  using  the  condition
            which  is returned by [4mCreateRegistrationCondition[24m.  Note that [4mCre-[0m
            [4mateRegistrationCondition[24m is free to return [1mNIL [22mif the registration
            is already finished.
       [4mmsgHandler[24m:   [1mPROCEDURE[22m([4mobject[24m:   [4mMessages.Object[24m;  [1mVAR  [4m[22mmessage[24m:  [4mMes-[0m
            [4msages.Message[24m);
            is a message handler of type [4mMessages.Handler[24m which  is  installed
            by  [4mRemoteObjects[24m on the exporting side.  This handler has to con-
            vert incoming messages into operations.  Note  that  the  returned
            message  must  be of the same type as the incoming message, other-
            wise the message is considered as unprocessed message.  Note  that
            [4mmsgHandler[24m is optional and may be specified as [1mNIL[22m.

   [1mExporting objects[0m
       An  application which is going to export objects, i.e. which is willing
       to allow other processes to  access  some  of  its  objects,  needs  to
       declare  at  least  one  port  where  other  processes may direct their
       requests to.  [4mAddPort[24m adds the given [4mport[24m (which must be a  local  net-
       work  address)  to  the list of ports [4mRemoteObjects[24m listens to.  [4mExport[0m
       makes the given object accessible from outside and writes  its  address
       to the given stream which may be later read by [4mImport[24m or [4mGuardedImport[24m.
       Note that [1mNIL [22mmay be passed to [4mExport[24m and therefore later  be  returned
       by [4mImport[24m or [4mGuardedImport[24m.

       Not  all  extensions  of  [4mServices.Object[24m  are  necessarily  exportable
       because  this  depends  on  the  existence  of  an  associated  service
       provider.   [4mExportable[24m  allows to test whether a specific object can be
       exported or not.

       Note that [4mAddPort[24m and [4mExport[24m lead to the creation of tasks.  Because of
       this,  the  program  does not necessarily finish when all module bodies
       have terminated.  [4mRemoveAllPorts[24m causes [4mRemoteObjects[24m to terminate  all
       tasks which listen for new connections but to keep all existing connec-
       tions alive.  [4mCloseAllConnections[24m requests [4mRemoteObjects[24m to  close  all
       connections  gratefully  (i.e.  with  notification of the communication
       partner).  To terminate  all  tasks  of  [4mRemoteObjects[24m,  [4mRemoveAllPorts[0m
       should  be called before [4mCloseAllConnections[24m, otherwise new connections
       could be opened after closing all old connections.

       [4mRemoveAllPorts[24m and [4mCloseAllConnections[24m should usually be called on pro-
       cess  termination  only  and  not  to  close down single services.  The
       export status of an object is  better  rejected  by  calling  [4mWithdraw[24m.
       Note  that  connections  are  implicitly  closed when all proxy objects
       which use them are dropped (see below).

   [1mImporting objects[0m
       [4mImport[24m allows to read an object address from the  given  stream  (which
       has  been earlier written by [4mExport[24m) and creates a proxy object for it.
       Proxy objects delegate all operations (including those of [4mPersistentOb-[0m
       [4mjects(3)[24m)  to  the original object, wait for completion, and return the
       results.

       [4mGuardedImport[24m allows to apply a  type  guard  to  the  imported  object
       before  it gets assigned to [4mobject[24m.  [4mGuardedImport[24m returns [1mTRUE [22monly if
       [4mImport[24m would have been successful, and the imported object is an exten-
       sion  of  [4mguard[24m, or it is [1mNIL[22m.  Thus, [4mGuardedImport[24m works like implicit
       type tests which are possibly applied for  pointer  assignments  (where
       [1mNIL  [22mis  always accepted) but not like type tests or type guards (where
       [1mNIL [22mwould cause them to fail with a runtime error).

       [4mRemoteObjects[24m supports [4mResources(3)[24m for distributed objects:

       ·      Proxy objects terminate when the original object terminates.

       ·      Exported objects becomes unreferenced only when no party (either
              local or remote) uses it.

       ·      Proxy  objects  which  become  locally  unreferenced  are  being
              dropped, i.e. they will no longer claim  any  network  resources
              which were allocated for them.

       [4mRemoteObjects[24m  guarantees  that re-imports return the same proxy object
       as the first import (as long it has not  been  dropped).   If  a  party
       imports objects which have been exported by itself, the original refer-
       ence is returned.  Note that proxy objects may be exported like  origi-
       nal objects.  In this case, importing parties will delegate their oper-
       ations to the original object and not to  the  exported  proxy  object.
       Therefore,  object  identity is preserved independently from the number
       of involved intermediate parties which have re-exported that object.

   [1mRecovery[0m
       By default, proxy objects will terminate if the connection to the orig-
       inal  object gets unrecoverably lost.  This may be unsatisfactory if it
       would be possible to re-import the object by other methods (and  possi-
       bly  somewhat  later).   In  this case, [4mInstallRecoverHandler[24m allows to
       install a recovery procedure [4mrecover[24m for a proxy object which  will  be
       called  in  case  of  broken connections on the client side.  Note that
       multiple  or  invalid  calls  of  [4mInstallRecoverHandler[24m  are   silently
       ignored.  The recovery procedure [4mrecover[24m is of type [4mRecoverProc[24m and has
       either to terminate the proxy object (by calling  [4mResources.Notify[24m)  or
       to  successfully  re-import  the  given object by using [4mReImport[24m.  This
       procedure may block the current task for longer  time  periods  and  is
       also free to try re-imports many times.

       Proxy  objects  which are supported by a recovery procedure will switch
       to the state [4mResources.communicationStopped[24m when the associated connec-
       tion  breaks.   Later,  when  the recovery procedure returns, the state
       will switch to [4mResources.communicationResumed[24m  in  case  of  successful
       recovery and to [4mResources.terminated[24m otherwise.

[1mDIAGNOSTICS[0m
       Errors and network failures lead to events.  All procedures which offer
       an [4merrors[24m parameter relate all  events  to  this  parameter.   Messages
       which cannot be delivered or received due to network failures carry the
       associated events in the [4merrors[24m component.  Operations  of  [4mPersistent-[0m
       [4mDisciplines(3)[24m  relate  error  events  to  the proxy object.  Following
       error codes are implemented:
       [4maccessFailed[24m       [4mRemoteObjects[24m is unable to establish a connection to
                          the given network address.
       [4mclosedConnection[24m   The  connection  has  been  gratefully closed by the
                          partner.
       [4mconnectionBroken[24m   The communication channel was alive and is now  bro-
                          ken.
       [4mdroppedObject[24m      Cannot  send further messages because the object was
                          dropped (i.e. it became unreferenced).
       [4minvalidMessage[24m     An unexpected message which does not follow the pro-
                          tocol was received.
       [4minvalidPartner[24m     Either  the  input  from  the network connection has
                          been garbled, or the network partner does not follow
                          the protocol of [4mRemoteObjects[24m.
       [4mlistenerKilled[24m     The  associated  channel listener has been killed by
                          [4mCloseAllConnections[24m or due  to  program  termination
                          (see [4mProcess(3)[24m).
       [4mobjectWithdrawn[24m    The  remote  object  has  been  withdrawn  and is no
                          longer accessible from outside.
       [4mreceiveFailed[24m      [4mRemoteObjects[24m has sent the  message  to  the  remote

       [4msendFailed[24m         [4mRemoteObjects[24m  was unable to send the message to the
                          remote object.
       [4mtypeGuardFailure[24m   Returned by [4mGuardedImport[24m  if  the  to  be  imported
                          object is neither [1mNIL [22mnor an extension of [4mguard[24m.
       [4munexportableObject[24m There  is  no ``RemoteObjects'' service provider for
                          the given object and no one could be loaded  dynami-
                          cally (see [4mServices(3)[24m and [4mLoader(3)[24m).
       [4munknownObject[24m      While  a  valid network address was given to [4mImport[24m,
                          the object is not known on the other side.
       [4munknownType[24m        The imported object is of an unknown type and it was
                          not  possible  to load the associated module dynami-
                          cally (see [4mLoader(3)[24m).
       [4munsupportedType[24m    The imported object is of a type  which  is  locally
                          not  supported  by  an  associated ``RemoteObjects''
                          service.
       [4mprivateObject[24m      An object could not be imported as it has no  public
                          ports, i.e. [4mAddPort[24m was not called by its owner. One
                          possible scenario for this is a process A with  pub-
                          lic  ports that exports objects to process B with no
                          public ports. As there exists already an open  chan-
                          nel  between  A  and  B,  A has no problem to import
                          objects from B as long as they come by request of  A
                          (i.e.  as  parameter  of  a  procedure  of A that is
                          called by B). However, B  cannot  make  this  object
                          accessible to other processes as they need to estab-
                          lish their own channel to B which  fails  as  B  has
                          never opened a port.
