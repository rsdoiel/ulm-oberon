       _S_y_s_C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s  is  an  interface to the runtime system which
       collects commands (parameterless exported procedures) dur­
       ing the early runtime startup.

       Because  the  modules where the commands belong to are not
       necessarily initialized it is important to call  the  _i_n_i_t
       procedure  of  _M_o_d_u_l_e_R_e_c  prior  to calls of any commands.
       Only the first call of an initialization  part  is  effec­
       tive, all further calls are no-operations.

       The  order  of modules is topological and in linkage order
       in case of unrelated modules.  Command lists are in  order
       of appearance (in source code).

       It  is important to note that the components of _C_o_m_m_a_n_d_R_e_c
       are read-only because they are part of the UNIX text  seg­
       ment.   The  pointer  components of the records _C_o_m_m_a_n_d_R_e_c
       and _M_o_d_u_l_e_R_e_c are protected  against  tracing  of  garbage
       collectors.

       Modules  do not insert their parameterless exported proce­
       dures by default into the structure of  _S_y_s_C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s.   The
       --CC  flag  must  be  given  at  compile time (see _o_c_(_1_)) to
       enable this feature.  The current version of  the  library
