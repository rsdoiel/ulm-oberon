[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mSysTypes[24m  exports  some  types  frequently used for system calls.  They
       correspond to types of [4m/usr/include/sys/types.h[24m:

       Oberon type   C-type    description
       ------------------------------------------------------------
       [4mFile[24m          [1mint       [22mfile descriptor
       [4mAddress[24m       [1mcaddr_t   [22mcore address type
       [4mOffset[24m        [1moff_t     [22mfile positions and offsets
       [4mCount[24m         [1moff_t     [22msynonym for [4mOffset[0m
       [4mDevice[24m        [1mdev_t     [22mmajor and minor number
       [4mInode[24m         [1mino_t     [22minode number
       [4mTime[24m          [1mtime_t    [22mnumber of seconds since Jan 1, 1970
       [4mSize[24m          [1msize_t    [22mnumber of bytes

       The type [4mWord[24m is defined to be equivalent to [1mint [22mof the C language.   C
       traditionally  defines  the [1mint [22mdata type to have the same width as the
       CPU bus (i.e. a machine word).

[1mSEE ALSO[0m
       [4mTypes(3)[24m   compiler dependent type definitions

[1mBUGS[0m
       The reason for [4mCount[24m is historical: unrevised Oberon does  not  support
       parameter names in procedure types.  So different type identifiers were
       used to distinguish parameters.
