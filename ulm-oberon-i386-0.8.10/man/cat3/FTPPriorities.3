       FTPPriorities  -  priorities  of  the  core tasks of a FTP
       server

       _F_T_P_P_r_i_o_r_i_t_i_e_s defines the priorities  that  are  used  for
       _P_r_i_o_r_i_t_y_J_o_b_s_(_3_)  for  the core tasks of a FTP server.  The
       top priorities are given to the listener that reads incom­
       ing  commands and the responser that sends the return mes­
       sage to minimize latency times in the  main  communication
       channel.

       The  tasks  that  are  responsible for the transmission of
       data operate at  medium  priorities.  This,  for  example,
       causes  the  return  code of a PPOORRTT command to be returned
       before the server tries to establish a connection  to  the
       given port.

       Logging and timeout management are running at lower prior­
       ity values.

       The given system of priorities opens the risk that logging
       information  for already processed commands is lost if the
       FTP server process is killed  in  between  or  if  logging
       fails for other reasons (no disk space available etc).
