[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mSysMonitor[24m is a system-dependant module that allows to generate an exe-
       cution time profile that is based on [4mprofil(2)[24m.

       During its initialization, a [4mprofil(2)[24m buffer is allocated that  is  as
       large  as  the  text  segment.  A [4mprofil(2)[24m buffer consists of unsigned
       16-bit counters. When profiling starts, the operating system increments
       on  each  clock  tick the counter within the buffer that corresponds to
       the currently executed instruction. If a program runs for a  sufficient
       number  of  clock ticks, the resulting statistics gives a rough impres-
       sion how much time is spent within each procedure.

       [4mStart[24m initializes the entire [4mprofil(2)[24m buffer to zeroes and starts pro-
       filing.

       [4mStop[24m  stops  profiling and prints the resulting statistics to the given
       stream. An output line is generated for each procedure  with  at  least
       one non-zero counter in the following format: Some optional spaces fol-
       lowed by a whole positive number, followed by one space and a qualified
       procedure  name  (module  and procedure name, separated by a dot).  The
       order of the output lines depends only of the order of modules and pro-
       cedures within the [4mSysModules(3)[24m data structure.

       [4mSysSegments(3)[24m   The segment with number 0 of [4mSysSegments(3)[24m is consid-
                        ered to be the text segment.

[1mBUGS[0m
       Ambiguities caused by multiple procedures with the same name within the
       same module cannot be resolved.

       [4mSysMonitor[24m is not yet prepared for dynamically loaded modules.
