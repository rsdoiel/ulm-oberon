       _F_T_P_L_o_g_g_e_r_s  provides  an  interface  between a FTP command
       processing unit and all parties  that  are  interested  in
       logging  all  requests  (see _F_T_P_R_e_q_u_e_s_t_s_(_3_)) together with
       their responses (see _F_T_P_R_e_s_p_o_n_s_e_s_(_3_)) and  possible  error
       events in their context.

       FTP  command processing units are expected to call _L_o_g for
       _s_e_s_s_i_o_n after returning _r_e_s_p_o_n_s_e on  _r_e_q_u_e_s_t.   All  error
       events  found  related  to  _s_e_s_s_i_o_n (see _R_e_l_a_t_e_d_E_v_e_n_t_s_(_3_))
       will be removed.

       _G_e_t_E_v_e_n_t_T_y_p_e returns an event type  for  _s_e_s_s_i_o_n  that  is
       used by _L_o_g to distribute logging events to all interested
       parties.

       Error events that result from FTP operations should not be
       leaked to the FTP client but, if necessary, converted into
       a general error code. They should  be  logged  instead  to
       allow  problems  to  be analyzed by the administrator of a
       FTP server.

       Note, however, that not all  error  events  indicate  real
       error  situations as error events may result from harmless
       tests.  _F_T_P_U_n_i_x_F_i_l_e_S_y_s_t_e_m_s_(_3_), for example, checks a given
       filename  for existance and for being a symbolic link (see
       _F_T_P_U_n_i_x_P_a_t_h_s_(_3_))  before  opening  it  for  writing.  This
       causes  most SSTTOORR operations to be logged together with an
       error event while a success indication might have returned
       to the FTP client.
