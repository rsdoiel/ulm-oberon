ScanDir(3)                    Ulm's Oberon System                   ScanDir(3)



[1mNAME[0m
       ScanDir - pattern directed directory scan

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       PROCEDURE Match(filename, pattern: ARRAY OF CHAR) : BOOLEAN;
       PROCEDURE Open(VAR s: Streams.Stream; pattern: ARRAY OF CHAR);


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mScanDir[24m  implements the patterns of [4msh(1)[24m and allows a [4msh(1)[24m-compatible
       file pattern evaluation.  Patterns are defined as follows:

       ?        matches any character
       *        matches any (possibly empty) sequence
       [...]    matches any character inside []
       [!...]   matches any character but those inside []
       [a-z]    matches letters 'a' to 'z'
       \[4mx[24m       matches [4mx[0m
       [4mx[24m        matches [4mx[0m
       Note that "*" does not match directory slashes ("/")  and  "."  at  the
       beginning of a path component.

       [4mMatch[24m returns [1mTRUE [22mif [4mfilename[24m matches [4mpattern[24m.

       [4mOpen[24m  returns  a  stream with the list of filenames matched by [4mpattern[24m.
       The filenames are in  alphabetically  order  and  0X-terminated.   Ini-
       tially,  0X  is  the line terminator in the sense of [4mStreamDisciplines[24m.
       Directories without read and execute permission are not examined.

[1mEXAMPLE[0m
       Following example prints the filenames of all Oberon  source  files  in
       the current directory:

       PROCEDURE ListSources;
          VAR
             s: Streams.Stream;
             ch: CHAR;
       BEGIN
          ScanDir.Open(s, "*.o[dm]");
          WHILE Streams.ReadByte(s, ch) DO
             IF ch = 0X THEN
                Write.Ln;
             ELSE
                Write.Char(ch);
             END;
          END;
          Streams.Release(s);
       END ListSources;


[1mDIAGNOSTICS[0m
       Errors  during  the  access  of the stream are converted into events of
       [4mRelatedEvents[24m.  By default, these  events  are  being  queued.   Errors
       which result from failures of examining directories do not lead to read
       errors, so [4mScanDir[24m skips unreadable  directories  instead.   Thus,  the
       only way to check for failures is to examine the event queue.

[1mSEE ALSO[0m
       [4msh(1)[24m                  Bourne shell: shell patterns
       [4mRelatedEvents(3)[24m       handling of error events
       [4mStreamDisciplines(3)[24m   definition of line terminator

       [4mTexts(3)[24m               in-memory streams

[1mBUGS[0m
       There  are  no  patterns  which  allow a recursive traverse (compare to
       "[...]" of VMS).
