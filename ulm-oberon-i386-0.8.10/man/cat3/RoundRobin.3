       _C_r_e_a_t_e_T_a_s_k_G_r_o_u_p  creates and returns a task group which is
       managed by a round robin scheduler, i.e. tasks  must  sus­
       pend  themselves  explicitely  and the task which is ready
       and has not been executed for the  longest  time  will  be
       executed next.

       _S_c_h_e_d_u_l_e_r_s_(_3_)   general scheduler interface which provides
                       routines for adding tasks to a task  group
                       and for starting the scheduler.
       _S_y_s_M_a_i_n_(_3_)      creates  the  main  task  group on base of

       _T_a_s_k_s_(_3_)        offers routines which allow to suspend, or
                       to  wait  for a given set of conditions or
                       to terminate the current task.
