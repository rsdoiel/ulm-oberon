       _F_T_P_R_e_s_p_o_n_s_e_s  provides  in  _R_e_s_p_o_n_s_e a persistent type for
       outgoing FTP responses, a procedure that  sends  responses
       over  network  connections,  and an event type that may be
       used for logging (see _F_T_P_L_o_g_g_e_r_s_(_3_)) or marks (see _F_T_P_S_e_s_­
       _s_i_o_n_s_(_3_)).

       A FTP response consists in conformance to RFC 959 of a

       ·      return code, consisting of three digits, and

       ·      some  human  readable text that may extend multiple
              lines.

       _C_r_e_a_t_e may be used to create responses. In  dependence  of
       the  length  of  _t_e_x_t,  the  message is either stored into
       _s_h_o_r_t_t_e_x_t, or, in case of longer messages, represented  as
       persistent text that is accessible as stream.

       _S_e_n_d_R_e_s_p_o_n_s_e  sends  _r_e_s_p_o_n_s_e in conformance to RFC 959 to
       _s.  Line terminators which are to be represented as simple
       _A_S_C_I_I_._n_l  (in conformance to _S_t_r_e_a_m_D_i_s_c_i_p_l_i_n_e_s_(_3_)) will be
       converted into sequences of _A_S_C_I_I_._c_r and _A_S_C_I_I_._l_f.   Like­
       wise,  _S_e_n_d_R_e_s_p_o_n_s_e  takes  care  of  the 00FFFFXX telnet code
       escape characters and doubles them.

       _S_e_n_d_R_e_s_p_o_n_s_e returns FFAALLSSEE in case of  failures  but  does
       not generate any error events on its own.

       _F_T_P_R_e_q_u_e_s_t_s_(_3_)         sibling  of this module that offers
                              a persistent type for FTP  requests
                              and  an  operation  that  allows to
                              read them from network connections.
