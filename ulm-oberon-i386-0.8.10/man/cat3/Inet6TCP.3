[1mNAME[0m
       Inet6TCP - TCP/IPv6 based implementation of [4mNetworks(3)[0m

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       TYPE Address = IPv6TCPSockets.SocketAddress;

       PROCEDURE CreateAddress(VAR address: Networks.Address; ipaddr: Address);
       PROCEDURE ConvertAddress(address: Networks.Address; VAR ipaddr: Address);
       PROCEDURE SetAddress(address: Networks.Address; ipaddr: Address);


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mInet6TCP[24m  is  a [4mNetworks(3)[24m implementation which is based upon [4mIPv6TCP-[0m
       [4mSockets(3)[24m.  [4mCreateAddress[24m takes an IPv6 address and converts it into a
       newly  created  general  network  address.   [4mConvertAddress[24m  allows the
       reverse conversion but requires [4maddress[24m to be returned earlier by  [4mCre-[0m
       [4mateAddress[24m.   [4mSetAddress[24m  allows  to  change a network address.  Again,
       [4maddress[24m must originate from [4mInet6TCP[24m.  General  network  addresses  are
       persistent  objects which allow the interface of [4mNetworks(3)[24m to be used
       which is independent from a particular network implementation.

[1mDIAGNOSTICS[0m
       Passing an invalid general network address (i.e. an address which  does
       not  originate  from [4mInet6TCP[24m) to [4mConvertAddress[24m or [4mSetAddress[24m causes a
       type guard to fail.
