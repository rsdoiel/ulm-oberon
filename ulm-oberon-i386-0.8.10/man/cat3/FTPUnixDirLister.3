       _F_T_P_U_n_i_x_D_i_r_L_i_s_t_e_r  offers some auxiliary functions for han­
       dlers of some FTP commands that list  the  contents  of  a
       directory or retrieve file properties.

       _G_e_t_F_i_l_e_T_y_p_e  returns  a  simplified file type of _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e.
       Files of type _o_t_h_e_r should usually neither be accessed nor
       shown by FTP services.

       _G_e_t_S_i_z_e  returns  the  size of _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e in bytes under the
       assumption  of  a  binary  transfer  mode.    _G_e_t_T_i_m_e_s_t_a_m_p
       returns,  in  conformance to _F_T_P_C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s_._m_d_t_m, the time of
       the last modification of _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e in the form  YYYYYYYYMMMMDDDDHHHH­­
       MMMMSSSS.

       _L_i_s_t prints to _s,

       ·      if  _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e  is  a  directory,  a filtered list of
              filenames contained in it, or,

       ·      if _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e is a regular file, a  single  line  for
              it.

       Lines  output  resemble that of ``/bin/ls -la'' if _l_o_n_g is
       set to TTRRUUEE, and to ``/bin/ls'' otherwise. However,

       ·      directory entries other than  directories,  regular
              files, and symbolic links are suppressed,

       ·      file  protection  modes  are always given as ``-rw-
              r--r--'' (for regular files),  ``drwxr-xr-x''  (for
              directories),   and  ``lrwxrwxrwx''  (for  symbolic

              links), and

       ·      the file owner is given as 00 (root). A  column  for
              group owner is not given.

       The  original  pathname  in  _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e  is  never revealed.
       Instead _r_e_l_p_a_t_h is printed, if given, and, in  case  of  a
       directory listing, the filename inside a directory is pro­
       vided.  The wildcard pattern _p_a_t_t_e_r_n is, if  given  for  a
       directory, matched against filenames inside of directories
       and works as filter.  Wildcard patterns are interpreted by
       _S_c_a_n_D_i_r_(_3_) but locally only against filenames found inside
       the directory specified by _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e. Multi-level  patterns
       like ``*/*'' do not work.

       All  occurences  of  newlines  in  directory  entries  are
       replaced by null bytes when being output to _s.

       _t_e_x_t_f_i_l_e would be shown as:

       All procedures return FFAALLSSEE in case of errors  and  relate
       all  error  events to _e_r_r_o_r_s but do not generate any error
