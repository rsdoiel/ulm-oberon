       _C_o_r_o_u_t_i_n_e_s  exports  some variables which are used and set
       by the runtime system.  All variables with  the  exception
       of _d_e_f_a_u_l_t_s_i_z_e are read-only.

       _d_e_f_a_u_l_t_s_i_z_e defines the default stack size of a coroutine.
       The size of the activation record of the procedure calling
       SSYYSSTTEEMM..CCRRSSPPAAWWNN  is  added  to _d_e_f_a_u_l_t_s_i_z_e.  The default is
       taken if the second parameter of SSYYSSTTEEMM..CCRRSSPPAAWWNN  is  omit­
       ted.

       _m_a_i_n  is allocated during module initialization and points
       to the main coroutine.

       The SSYYSSTTEEMM..CCRRSSWWIITTCCHH operation sets _s_o_u_r_c_e to  the  calling
       coroutine.

       _c_u_r_r_e_n_t points to the coroutine currently active.

       The  pointer  _t_a_g  points to a tag record which is used by
       all coroutines. This allows coroutines to be identified by
       the garbage collector.
