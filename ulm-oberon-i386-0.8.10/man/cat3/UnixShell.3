       UnixShell - pass a command to the system shell

       _C_o_m_m_a_n_d  passes  _c_m_d to the system shell (usually _/_b_i_n_/_s_h)
       for execution and blocks the invoking task until its  com­
       pletion.  TTRRUUEE will be returned and the exit status of the
       shell is to be found in _s_t_a_t_u_s (see _S_y_s_P_r_o_c_e_s_s_(_3_)) if _C_o_m_­
       _m_a_n_d  was able to create a subprocess.  _S_y_s_S_i_g_n_a_l_s_._I_N_T and
       _S_y_s_S_i_g_n_a_l_s_._Q_U_I_T will be ignored during command  execution.

       _C_o_m_m_a_n_d returns FFAALLSSEE and passes error events to _e_r_r_o_r_s if
       it is unable to create a new process (see  _S_y_s_P_r_o_c_e_s_s_(_3_)).
       An  exit  code  of  127  may  result from the inability to
       invoke the system shell.

       _U_n_i_x_P_i_p_e_s_(_3_)    reading or feeding from/to a UNIX command

BBUUGGSS
       There is no provision to distinguish a successful  command
       execution  with exit code 127 from the inability to invoke
       the system shell.

       _C_o_m_m_a_n_d does not close any file descriptors.  This  causes
       the  detection of closed pipes that were open at the invo­
       cation time to be postponed  until  the  command  is  com­
       pleted.
