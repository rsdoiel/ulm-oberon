       _F_T_P_A_u_t_h_R_e_a_d_e_r  provides a FTP command handler (see _F_T_P_S_e_s_­
       _s_i_o_n_s_(_3_))  that  processes  the   FTP   commands   _F_T_P_C_o_m_­
       _m_a_n_d_s_._u_s_e_r, _F_T_P_C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s_._p_a_s_s, and _F_T_P_C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s_._a_c_c_t.

       _A_d_d_H_a_n_d_l_e_r  installs  a handler for _s_e_s_s_i_o_n that processes
       the three  FTP  authorization  commands  of  RFC  959  and
       invokes  _h_a_n_d_l_e_r  as  soon  a  user name and an associated
       password are provided.  _h_a_n_d_l_e_r is expected to  return  in
       dependance of the supplied credentials either TTRRUUEE in case
       of a successful authorization or FFAALLSSEE otherwise. A  short
       response text is to be stored in _m_e_s_s_a_g_e.

       _G_e_t_U_s_e_r_N_a_m_e  and _G_e_t_P_a_s_s_w_o_r_d return the credentials trans­
       mitted earlier to the FTP  commands  _F_T_P_C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s_._u_s_e_r  and
       _F_T_P_C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s_._p_a_s_s, respectively.

       _A_u_t_h_o_r_i_z_e_d returns TTRRUUEE if a user name and a password were
       supplied.  It does not, however, tell whether  the  autho­
       rization  was  successful. This is indicated by the public
       component _a_u_t_h_o_r_i_z_e_d of _s_e_s_s_i_o_n.

       _F_T_P_A_u_t_h_R_e_a_d_e_r  does  not  generate  any  error  events  on
       itself.  The  handler  passwd to _A_d_d_H_a_n_d_l_e_r is expected to
       relate any error events to _s_e_s_s_i_o_n.

       Care should be taken  to  prevent  secret  passwords  from
       being  logged.   This is neither done by _F_T_P_A_u_t_h_R_e_a_d_e_r nor
       by _F_T_P_L_o_g_g_e_r_s_(_3_).

       The authentication handler should not reveal in  its  mes­
       sage  details  of  authorization  failures.  Instead these
       should, if necessary, packaged in error  events  that  are
       related to _s_e_s_s_i_o_n.

       While  _F_T_P_A_u_t_h_R_e_a_d_e_r  supports  multiple authorizations in
       one session, it is not recommended to accept this as other
       FTP  command handlers are not necessarily prepared for re-
       initializations. Instead it is better to run a  non-anony­
       mous FTP service in three phases:

       ·      using  a session that offers authorization commands
              only,

       ·      a handler that, once a user name and a password are
              provided,  passes  the  credentials  to an external
              authority checker  which,  on  success,  optionally
              performs  operations  with  root  privileges (e.g.,
              chroot, setgid, and setuid), and,

       ·      creating a new session with all necessary FTP  com­
              mand  handlers  (except for authorization commands)
              that should run with the privileges associated with
              the credentials (hopefully not root) given earlier.
