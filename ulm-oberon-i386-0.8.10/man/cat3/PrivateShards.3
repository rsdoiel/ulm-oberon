       _P_r_i_v_a_t_e_S_h_a_r_d_s  provides pairs of pots and lids intended to
       fit exactly to each other but to none else.  Each call  of
       _C_r_e_a_t_e  yields  a different pot.  Uniqueness, however, can
       not be granted for pots created  by  different  processes,
       although  even in that case coincidences are very improba­
       ble.
