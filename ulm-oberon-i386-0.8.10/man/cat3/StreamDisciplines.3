[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mStreamDisciplines[24m exports some general characteristics of streams which
       are used by scanning and printing modules like [4mRead(3)[24m or [4mWrite(3)[24m.

       Line terminators are strings up to four characters which must be  pair-
       wise  different.   [1m0X [22mas line terminator is to be encoded as empty line
       terminator (i.e. first element equals [1m0X[22m).  Default  is  [4mASCII.EOL[24m  and
       may  be  modified  by [4mSetLineTerm[24m.  The line terminator of [4mStreamDisci-[0m
       [4mplines[24m is independent of the line terminator of [4mStreams[24m which  is  used
       for line buffered streams.

       White  space  is  the  set of characters which is to be skipped on read
       operations  (e.g.  [4mRead.Int[24m).   By  default  it   contains   [4mASCII.tab[24m,
       [4mASCII.nl[24m,  [4mASCII.np[24m,  and  [4mASCII.sp[24m.   [4mSetWhiteSpace[24m  and [4mGetWhiteSpace[0m
       allow to access the white space character set.

       Lines could be viewed as records which consists  of  fields  which  are
       separated  by  field  separators.   The  default  field  separators are
       [4mASCII.tab[24m, [4mASCII.nl[24m, [4mASCII.np[24m and [4mASCII.sp[24m.   [4mSetFieldSetSet[24m  and  [4mGet-[0m
       [4mFieldSepSet[24m allow to set and retrieve the set of separators.

       [4mGetFieldSep[24m returns one of the field separators which is intended to be
       the output field separator.  [4mSetFieldSep[24m adds [4mfieldsep[24m to  the  set  of
       field  separators  and  selects [4mfieldsep[24m to be the one returned by [4mGet-[0m
       [4mFieldSep[24m.  [4mGetFieldSep[24m returns the  field  separator  with  the  lowest
       ordinal value if no separator has been selected by [4mSetFieldSep[24m.

       The  set of separators should be interpreted as set of skipping charac-
       ters between fields if the set of whitespace characters is a subset  of
       the  set  of field separators.  In all other cases each field separator
       works as delimiter between two fields, i.e. empty fields are  possible.

       Field extracting procedures are expected to strip off surrounding white
       space.  The set of white space charactes should be set to the empty set
       if this behaviour is not preferred.

       Some  streams  maintain  an  actual non-negative indentation width.  In
       this case each line should be preceded by a call of [4mWrite.Indent[24m.   The
       indentation width may be set, retrieved and modified by [4mSetIndentation-[0m
       [4mWidth[24m,  [4mGetIndentationWidth[24m,  and  [4mIncrIndentationWidth[24m.   [4mStreamDisci-[0m
       [4mplines[24m silently ignores calls which try to set the indentation width to
       a negative value.

[1mDIAGNOSTICS[0m
       [4mSetFieldSepSet[24m raises [4mbadfieldsepset[24m on empty sets with priority [4mPrior-[0m
