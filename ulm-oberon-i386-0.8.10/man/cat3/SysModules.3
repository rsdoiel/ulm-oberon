       _S_y_s_M_o_d_u_l_e_s interfaces the list of modules and blocks which
       is generated during compile time and the runtime  initial­
       ization.   The  data structure pointed to by _m_o_d_u_l_e_s is to
       be considered read-only.  Please  note  that  the  pointer
       components  of  _M_o_d_u_l_e_R_e_c  and  _B_l_o_c_k_L_i_s_t_R_e_c are protected
       against traces by  the  garbage  collector  (see  _S_y_s_S_t_o_r_­
       _a_g_e_(_3_)).

       _S_y_s_M_o_d_u_l_e_s  is mainly used by the garbage collector and by
       _S_y_s_M_a_i_n which determines the initialization order.
