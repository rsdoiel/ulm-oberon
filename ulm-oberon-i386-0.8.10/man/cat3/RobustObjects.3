       By default, proxy objects of _R_e_m_o_t_e_O_b_j_e_c_t_s_(_3_) terminate if
       the connection to their original object breaks down, or if
       the other side terminates.  _R_o_b_u_s_t_O_b_j_e_c_t_s offers a  mecha­
       nism (based on _N_a_m_e_s_(_3_), _P_a_t_h_C_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n_s_(_3_) and some exten­
       sion features of _R_e_m_o_t_e_O_b_j_e_c_t_s_(_3_)) which allows to suspend
       the proxy object (instead of terminating it) in such cases
       until the original object is accessible again by the  name
       service (see _N_a_m_e_s_(_3_)).

       This mechanism requires the support of both sides:

       ·      The  exporting  side has to declare its object as a
              ``robust  object''  by  calling  either  _E_x_p_o_r_t  or
              _E_x_p_o_r_t_R   with  an  absolute  path  which  is  also

              accessible by other processes.

       ·      The importing side  should  import  the  object  by
              _I_m_p_o_r_t or _I_m_p_o_r_t_R to take advantage of the recovery
              mechanism of _R_o_b_u_s_t_O_b_j_e_c_t_s with  usually  the  same
              path  as  given  by  _E_x_p_o_r_t or _E_x_p_o_r_t_R on the other
              side.  Alternatively, _G_u_a_r_d_e_d_I_m_p_o_r_t  or  _G_u_a_r_d_e_d_I_m_­
              _p_o_r_t_R  may  be  used  to be safe against type guard
              failures.

       The paths  are  interpreted  as  described  by  _P_a_t_h_C_o_n_d_i_­
       _t_i_o_n_s_(_3_)   and  taken  relatively  to  _r_o_o_t  (if  _E_x_p_o_r_t_R,
       _I_m_p_o_r_t_R, or _G_u_a_r_d_e_d_I_m_p_o_r_t_R is  used).   The  authorization
       lid _a_u_t_h is used to access all components of the parts and
       passed to _P_a_t_h_C_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n_s_(_3_).  _E_x_p_o_r_t and _E_x_p_o_r_t_R pass _s_t_a_­
       _t_u_s  (just  _N_a_m_e_s_._e_x_a_m_i_n_e and _N_a_m_e_s_._c_h_a_n_g_e are to be given
       if non-NNIILL) to the equally named parameter of _N_a_m_e_s_._C_r_e_a_t_­
       _e_N_o_d_e.   Note  that  all  operations block until the whole
       path becomes accessible (see _P_a_t_h_C_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n_s_(_3_)).

       The suspension and reanimation of proxy  objects  is  sig­
       nalled by _R_e_s_o_u_r_c_e_s_(_3_): _R_e_s_o_u_r_c_e_s_._c_o_m_m_u_n_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_S_t_o_p_p_e_d and
       _R_e_s_o_u_r_c_e_s_._c_o_m_m_u_n_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_R_e_s_u_m_e_d.  No  operations  are  pro­
       cessed  while  the  proxy  object is suspended.  The proxy
       object terminates if the recovery mechanism fails  due  to
       fatal errors.

       Note  that  ``robust  objects'' may be freely exported and
       imported by using _R_e_m_o_t_e_O_b_j_e_c_t_s_(_3_) directly.  But they get
       their special property only if _I_m_p_o_r_t, _I_m_p_o_r_t_R, _G_u_a_r_d_e_d_I_m_­
       _p_o_r_t, or _G_u_a_r_d_e_d_I_m_p_o_r_t_R have been called on the  exporting
       side and _E_x_p_o_r_t or _E_x_p_o_r_t_R on the importing side.

       It is theoretically possible that on recovery an object is
       imported  which was already imported before.  In this case
       there will be two proxy objects pointing to the same orig­
       inal object.  This problem can be avoided by the exporting
       side if it does not make  the  original  object  available
       before _E_x_p_o_r_t or _E_x_p_o_r_t_R is called.

       Typing  errors  in  path names may cause all operations to
       hang infinitively.
