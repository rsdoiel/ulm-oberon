[1mNAME[0m
       UnixNames - import the public root

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       VAR errors: RelatedEvents.Object;

       PROCEDURE ImportPublicRoot(errors: RelatedEvents.Object) : BOOLEAN;


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mUnixNames[24m  attempts  to locate a public root and to insert it under the
       name ``pub'' into [4mNames.root[24m.

       Public roots are imported  by  [4mNamesBootService(3)[24m  and  [4mRobustRoots(3)[0m
       using  an address specification in the format [4mfqdn[24m:[4mport[24m where [4mfqdn[24m is a
       fully qualified domain name that can be resolved using [4mDNSResolvers(3)[24m.

       The address of the public root boot service can be specified

       ·      by using the environment variable [1mONS_ROOT[22m,

       ·      by  defining  a  TXT  record  for  the  current hostname that is
              returned by [4mGetFullyQualifiedHostName[24m for the attribute  ``ons''
              according to RFC 1464, or by

       ·      by  defining a similar TXT record for the current domain that is
              returned by [4mUnixHost.GetDomainName[24m.

       Note that if the enviroment variable [1mONS_ROOT [22mis given, its contents is
       the only address that is tried to find the public root, i.e. TXT record
       lookups for the current hostname or the current domain will be skipped.

       [4mImportPublicRoot[24m  allows to re-import the public root in case of a ter-
       mination of the previous public root.

[1mEXAMPLE[0m
       Following TXT records specifies that the public root boot  service  for
       the  domain  ``mathematik.uni-ulm.de''  is  hosted  at  ``thales.mathe-
       matik.uni-ulm.de'' on port 9880:

       mathematik.uni-ulm.de IN TXT "ons=thales.mathematik.uni-ulm.de:9880"


[1mDIAGNOSTICS[0m
       The error events of the initial attempt are queued in [4merrors[24m.

[1mENVIRONMENT[0m
       [4mONS_ROOT[24m   specifies the address of the public root boot service

[1mSEE ALSO[0m
       [4mIPv4NameSystems(3)[24m    allows to import root nodes using IPv4 sockets
       [4mNames(3)[24m              abstraction for name hierarchies
       [4mNamesBootService(3)[24m   service  which  exports  root  nodes   at   known
                             addresses
       [4mRobustRoots(3)[24m        technique that re-imports terminated root nodes
