       _M_a_p_s  allows  to map address ranges of a stream into other
       streams with  given  offsets.   _M_a_p_s_._S_t_r_e_a_m  supports  all
       stream  operations  except  _t_r_u_n_c provided they are imple­
       mented by the underlying diversions.   _S_t_r_e_a_m_s_._C_l_o_s_e  does
       not cause any of the diversions to be closed.

       _O_p_e_n  initializes  the given stream.  As long no maps have
       been added all read or write operations will fail.

       _A_d_d_M_a_p adds the interval [[_b_e_g_i_n...._e_n_d)) to the set of  legal
       address ranges.  An access to a byte inside of this inter­
       val is translated by _M_a_p_s to an access of the stream _t_o at
       _o_f_f_s_e_t  ++ _c_u_r_r_e_n_t _p_o_s_i_t_i_o_n -- _b_e_g_i_n.  If multiple maps have
       been added, they are considered in the invocation order of
       _A_d_d_M_a_p.    _M_a_p_s  differentiates  between  read  and  write
       accesses, i.e. a read-only and  a  write-only  stream  may
       cover the same address range.

       _V_a_l_i_d  returns  TTRRUUEE if _a_d_d_r_e_s_s is a valid address to read
       from.
