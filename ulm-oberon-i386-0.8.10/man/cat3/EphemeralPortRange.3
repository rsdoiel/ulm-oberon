[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The ephemeral port range is defined to be the range of ports from which
       anonymous ports are selected. This selection is  requested  if  a  port
       number of 0 is specified within a socket address.

       Unfortunately  the  system's  choice of an ephemeral port number can be
       easily predicted on most operating systems. This can be a security risk
       where blind forgeries can be a threat.  One example is the DNS protocol
       where UDP response packages can be successfully forged if the port num-
       ber and the request id of the DNS client can be easily guessed.

       [4mEphemeralPortRange[24m  allows  to  reduce  this  risk by helping to select
       unpredictable ports. [4mSet[24m and [4mGet[24m allow to set and to retrieve the range
       of ephemeral ports that are to be used. By default, a range of 32768 up
       to 65535 is taken. This default can be changed by environment variables
       (see below).

       [4mGetRandomPort[24m  returns a port number out of the range of ephemeral port
       numbers using the unpredictable sequence of pseudo random numbers  [4mRan-[0m
       [4mdomGenerators.unpredictable[24m.

[1mDIAGNOSTICS[0m
       [4mGet[24m  asserts that [4msmallest[24m is smaller than [4mlargest[24m and that both values
       are within the range of valid port numbers.

[1mENVIRONMENT[0m
       [4mEPHEMERAL_PORT_RANGE_SMALLEST[24m   Default value of the smallest ephemeral
                                       port number.
       [4mEPHEMERAL_PORT_RANGE_LARGEST[24m    Default  value of the largest ephemeral
                                       port number.
