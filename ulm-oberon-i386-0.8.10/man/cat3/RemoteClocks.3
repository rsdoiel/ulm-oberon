[1mNAME[0m
       RemoteClocks - [4mRemoteObjects[24m service provider for [4mClocks.Clock[0m

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       PROCEDURE SetCapabilities(clock: Clocks.Clock; caps: Clocks.CapabilitySet);


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mRemoteClocks[24m  provides the ``RemoteObjects'' service for clocks of type
       [4mClocks.Clock[24m.  All operations including timer operations are  supported
       provided the original object supports it.

       By  default,  [4mRemoteClocks[24m exports a clock with all capabilities except
       of [4mClocks.settime[24m. [4mSetCapabilities[24m allows to override the default for a
       particular clock.

[1mDIAGNOSTICS[0m
       [4mRemoteClocks[24m  does not generate any error events itself.  See [4mRemoteOb-[0m
       [4mjects(3)[24m for network-related failures.

[1mSEE ALSO[0m
       [4mClocks(3)[24m          general abstraction for clocks
       [4mRemoteObjects(3)[24m   mechanism which allows to export and import objects

[1mBUGS[0m
       Note that [4mRemoteClocks[24m does not attempt to take the time  delay  caused
       by  the  network  into account. This cannot be done in the general case
       anyway because not all clocks are directly related to UTC.
