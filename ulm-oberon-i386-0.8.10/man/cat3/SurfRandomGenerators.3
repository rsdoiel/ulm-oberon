       designed by Daniel J. Bernstein.

       [4mCreate[24m creates a new sequence of numbers generated from this  generator
       in  dependendance  of [4mseed[24m from where the next 44 32-bit integer values
       are taken. The seed sequence should be unpredictable by itself, [4mRandom-[0m
       [4mGenerators.seed[24m is recommended. Rewind and restart operations from [4mRan-[0m
       [4mdomGenerators(3)[24m are supported.
