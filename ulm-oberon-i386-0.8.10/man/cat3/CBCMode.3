       _C_B_C_M_o_d_e  supports  a  special  mode of operation for block
       ciphers, the so called Cipher Block Chaining. If  a  block
       cipher  is  used  in  this  mode  blocks are not encrypted
       seperately anymore but depend on all previously  encrypted
       blocks.

       _C_r_e_a_t_e  creates a cipher _n_e_w which operates like the block
       cipher _o_l_d in cipher block chaining mode.
