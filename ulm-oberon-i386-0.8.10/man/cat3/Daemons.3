[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mDaemons[24m  manages  network daemons that provide services across the net-
       work using self-defined protocols.  Each daemon is  associated  with  a
       port  other  parties  can connect to.  On each incoming connect a dedi-
       cated task running a procedure of  type  [4mServiceForChannel[24m  is  spawned
       that is responsible for the dialogue with the connecting party.

       [4mStart[24m  starts a daemon that runs in a newly created task and listens to
       port [4mplugin[24m. Note that [4mdaemon[24m is to be created by the  caller.   [4mCreate[0m
       creates  and starts a daemon that runs in a newly created task and lis-
       tens to port [4mplugin[24m.

       Daemons may be shut down by terminating them (see  [4mResources(3)[24m).   The
       dialogue  running  procedures of type [4mServiceForChannel[24m are expected to
       finish when  their  daemon  object  terminates.   They  must  not  call
       [4mTasks.Terminate[24m but have to return as they are run by [4mJobs(3)[24m.

[1mDIAGNOSTICS[0m
       [4mDaemons[24m has no error event types of its own.  Error events generated by
       the underlying modules during creation time are passed to [4merrors[24m,  oth-
       erwise to the [4mdaemon[24m object.

[1mSEE ALSO[0m
       [4mNetworks(3)[24m    general abstraction for network connections
       [4mResources(3)[24m   cooperative handling of shared objects
