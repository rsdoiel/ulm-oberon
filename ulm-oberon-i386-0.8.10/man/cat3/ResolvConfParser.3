[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mResolvConfParser[24m   parses   configuration   files   that   conform   to
       [4mresolv.conf(5)[24m.  This module does not impose the limits of  the  tradi-
       tional resolver library for C. The number of nameservers is not limited
       and conflicting configurations like ``domain'' and ``search''  can  co-
       exist.

       [4mParse[24m parses [4ms[24m and creates a configuration [4mconf[24m.

       [4mIterateNameServers[24m  creates  an  iterator  that returns objects of type
       [4mNameServer[24m for each of the ``nameserver'' declarations within the  con-
       figuration [4mconf[24m.

       [4mIterateSearchList[24m creates an iterator that returns objects of type [4mCon-[0m
       [4mstStrings.String[24m for each of the domains that are specified within  the
       ``search'' declaration.

       [4mIterateSortLists[24m  creates  an  iterator  that  returns  objects of type
       [4mSortListMember[24m for each of the networks that are specified  within  the
       ``sortlist'' declaration.

       Iterators  created by [4mIterateOption[24m return an object of type [4mOption[24m for
       all options that are declared with an ``option'' directive.   [4mGetOption[0m
       allows  to retrieve option values by option names. [1mFALSE [22mis returned if
       an option named [4mname[24m was not found within the configuration.

       [4mGetLocalDomain[24m returns the domain specified with the ``domain''  direc-
       tive, if provided.

[1mDIAGNOSTICS[0m
       [4mParse[24m  generates  error  events  and  returns  [1mFALSE  [22min case of syntax
       errors:
       [4mdottedDecimalExpected[24m   a  dotted  decimal  (e.g.  ``127.0.0.1'')   was
                               expected but not found
       [4mkeywordExpected[24m         a  keyword  (e.g.  ``nameserver'') was expected
                               but not found
       [4mdomainExpected[24m          a valid domain name was expected but not found
       [4mmultipleDomains[24m         more than one ``domain'' declaration was found
       [4mintegerExpected[24m         an integer value was expected but not found

[1mFILES[0m
       [4m/etc/resolv.conf[24m   The standard location for this configuration file.

[1mSEE ALSO[0m
       [4mDNSStdResolvers(3)[24m   implements  [4mDNSResolvers(3)[24m  using   configuration
                            files of this type
