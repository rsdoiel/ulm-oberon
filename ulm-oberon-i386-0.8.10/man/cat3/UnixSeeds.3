       UnixSeeds - generation of seed values in the UNIX operating system

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mUnixSeeds[24m initializes [4mRandomGenerators.seed[24m and [4mRandomGenerators.unpre-[0m
       [4mdictable[24m when loaded.

       If available, [4m/dev/urandom[24m or [4m/dev/random[24m are selected and processed by
       [4mSeedStreams(3)[24m.   Alternatively,  [4mUnixStatusSeeds(3)[24m is used with a set
       of status retrieving shell commands that generate texts that  are  hard
       to  predict.  The implementation of [4mSurfRandomGenerators(3)[24m is used for
       the unpredictable sequence on base of the selected seed sequence.
