       SeedStreams - representation of streams as seed sequences

       PROCEDURE Create(VAR sequence: RandomGenerators.Sequence;
                        seeds: Streams.Stream);


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mSeedStreams[24m  allows  a  stream  to be represented as a sequence of seed
       values.  This implementation is mainly useful to access random  devices
       like  [4m/dev/random[24m  through  the  operations of [4mRandomGenerators(3)[24m.  As
       good seed values are a limited source,  other  random  generators  like
       [4mSurfRandomGenerators(3)[24m should be used for stretching.

       [4mCreate[24m  creates  a  sequence  that takes all its values from [4mseeds[24m.  In
       case of end of input or errors, zeroes are returned.
