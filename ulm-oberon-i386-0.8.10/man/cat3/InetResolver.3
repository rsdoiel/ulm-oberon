[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mInetResolver[24m  allows  to  map  host names to IPv4 or IPv6 addresses and
       vice versa.  This module is based on [4mDNSResolvers(3)[24m  and  one  of  its
       implementations (most likely [4mDNSStdResolvers(3)[24m).  Note that this means
       that a  working  DNS  cache  is  required.   Alternative  sources  like
       [4m/etc/hosts[24m  or  configurations  like [4m/etc/nsswitch.conf[24m are not consid-
       ered.

       [4mHostByAddr[24m stores the domain style address of [4maddress[24m  into  [4mhost[24m.   If
       the  name  server is unable to reverse the address, the IPv4 address is
       returned in the dotted-decimal representation.

       [4mAddrByHost[24m tries to convert the domain style address [4mhost[24m  to  an  IPv4
       address.  If successful, the address is stored into [4maddress[24m and [4mAddrBy-[0m
       [4mHost[24m returns [1mTRUE[22m.

       [4mHostByIPv6Addr[24m and [4mIPv6AddrByHost[24m operate like [4mHostByAddr[24m  and  [4mAddrBy-[0m
       [4mHost[24m but convert from or to IPv6 addresses.

       [4mGetHostName[24m  returns  the  host  name of the calling process.  The host
       name is given without the domain.   [4mGetDomainName[24m  returns  the  domain
       name  of  the  calling process.  The concatenation of the host name and
       the domain name (separated by ".") yields the full qualifying  name  of
       the current host machine.

[1mDIAGNOSTICS[0m
       In  case of failures, error events are generated by the underlying mod-
       ules.
