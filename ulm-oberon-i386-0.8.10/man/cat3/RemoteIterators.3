       _R_e_m_o_t_e_I_t_e_r_a_t_o_r_s  is  a  service  provider  (see  _R_e_m_o_t_e_O_b_­
       _j_e_c_t_s_(_3_) and  _S_e_r_v_i_c_e_s_(_3_))  which  allows  to  export  and
       import iterators created by _I_t_e_r_a_t_o_r_s_(_3_).

       _S_e_t_M_o_d_e  allows  to parameterize subsequent exports of _i_t.
       _p_a_c_k_e_t_l_e_n specifies the number of objects which are trans­
       ferred  in  one  packet  over  the network (a non-positive
       value means that all objects are to be sent in one packet)
       and  _m_o_d_e  selects  how  objects of the iterator are to be
       sent:
       _e_x_p_o_r_t_O_b_j_e_c_t_s   export, if supported, the objects  of  the
                       iterator.
       _c_o_p_y_O_b_j_e_c_t_s     copy (by using _P_e_r_s_i_s_t_e_n_t_O_b_j_e_c_t_s_._W_r_i_t_e and
                       _P_e_r_s_i_s_t_e_n_t_O_b_j_e_c_t_s_._R_e_a_d) the objects.
       Note that _R_e_m_o_t_e_I_t_e_r_a_t_o_r_s considers _m_o_d_e as a default  way
       of  transferring objects.  If the given mode is not appli­
       cable,  _R_e_m_o_t_e_I_t_e_r_a_t_o_r_s  checks  for  the  other  variant.
       Strings  of type _C_o_n_s_t_S_t_r_i_n_g_s_._S_t_r_i_n_g are additionally sup­
       ported.  Objects of the  iterator  which  can  be  neither
       exported nor copied are silently ignored.

       By  default,  _R_e_m_o_t_e_I_t_e_r_a_t_o_r_s  tries to export objects and
       uses a packet length of 1.

       _R_e_m_o_t_e_I_t_e_r_a_t_o_r_s does not generate itself any error events.
       See  _R_e_m_o_t_e_O_b_j_e_c_t_s_(_3_)  for  the usual set of trouble which
       might occur on network connections.
