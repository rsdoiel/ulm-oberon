[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mLargeTexts[24m  offers  the  same  semantics  as  [4mTexts(3)[24m but with another
       implementation which assures faster operation at the possible  cost  of
       more memory.  That means that ``Texts'' and ``Texts := LargeTexts'' are
       interchangable in the import list of a module without further modifica-
       tions.

[1mDIAGNOSTICS[0m
       By  default,  error  events  for  text streams are being queued.  Write
       operations fail never and read operations return [1mFALSE [22monly at the  end
       of  the  current text buffer.  Seek and trunc positions may fail due to
       invalid positions:
       [4mposBeyondCurrentLength[24m   Negative seek positions and  positions  beyond
                                the  current  length are invalid because [4mTexts[0m
                                does not support holes.
       [4minvalidTruncPos[24m          The trunc position must  be  non-negative  and
                                the  current position must not be subject to a
                                trunc operation.

[1mAUTHORS[0m
       The original implementation  is  due  to  Werner  Stanglow  (was  named
       [4mDbStrings[24m),  the  revisions  and  this  manual  page are due to Andreas
       Borchert.
