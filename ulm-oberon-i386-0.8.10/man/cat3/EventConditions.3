       _E_v_e_n_t_C_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n_s  creates  conditions  which  allow to wait
       until events of a given type are passed to _E_v_e_n_t_s_._R_a_i_s_e.

       _C_r_e_a_t_e creates a condition which evaluates to TTRRUUEE if  one
       or   more   events   of  _e_v_e_n_t_T_y_p_e  have  been  passed  to
       _E_v_e_n_t_s_._R_a_i_s_e.  _C_r_e_a_t_e defines  a  handler  for  _e_v_e_n_t_T_y_p_e.
       Additional  handlers  may  be defined by other modules but
       the  reaction  of  _e_v_e_n_t_T_y_p_e  must  not  be   changed   to
       _E_v_e_n_t_s_._d_e_f_a_u_l_t  or  _E_v_e_n_t_s_._i_g_n_o_r_e.  The handler queues all
       incoming events of _e_v_e_n_t_T_y_p_e.

       Multiple conditions may be  defined  for  the  same  event
       type.   In this case all incoming events are put into each
       of the queues.

       _D_r_o_p removes the associated queue of _c_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n.   This  is
       useful if _c_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n is no longer needed because it reduces
       the number of queues for the  associated  event  type  and
       assures  that the queue can be subject to the garbage col­
       lector.

       _T_e_s_t_A_n_d_G_e_t returns TTRRUUEE and the next event  if  there  are
       any events in the event queue of _c_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n.

       _B_l_o_c_k_i_n_g_E_v_e_n_t_s_(_3_)   similar  to _E_v_e_n_t_C_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n_s but blocks
                           the event raiser until all  interested
                           parties have seen the event
       _C_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n_s_(_3_)       interface for conditions
