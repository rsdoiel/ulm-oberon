       SysMain - determine initialization order

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       VAR mainTaskFinished: Events.EventType;


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mSysMain[24m  is  initialized  by the runtime startoff after building up the
       data structures of [4mSysModules(3)[24m and serves as handle  for  code  which
       determines the initialization order of the other modules.

       Not all modules which are linked together need to be initialized.  This
       could be useful if the decision about the module selection  depends  on
       command line arguments or the environment.

       The  module  bodies  protect themselves against multiple executions and
       each module body calls the initialization part of all imported modules.

       The   default  implementation  of  [4mSysMain[24m  creates  a  task  group  of
       [4mRoundRobin(3)[24m (which becomes the default task group  of  [4mTasks(3)[24m)  and
       adds as first task a coroutine which initializes all modules in linkage
       order:

       PROCEDURE InitAllModules;
          VAR
             module: SysModules.Module;
       BEGIN
          module := SysModules.modules;
          WHILE module # NIL DO
             module.init;
             module := module.next;
          END;
       END InitAllModules;


       Note that [4mSysMain[24m, and, in consequence, the process does not  necessar-
       ily  terminate  when  [4mInitAllModules[24m  terminates.  [4mSysMain[24m returns when
       there are no living tasks of the main  task  group  ([4mInitAllModules[24m  is
       just one of these tasks).

       The  [4mSysMain[24m  implementation  is expected to raise an event of the type
       [4mmainTaskFinished[24m as soon as all modules are initialized. This gives all
       modules the opportunity to shutdown unneeded tasks to allow the process
       to terminate if no real activities continue.
