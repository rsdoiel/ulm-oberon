       _U_n_i_x_T_e_r_m_i_n_a_l_s  provides  an  implementation  for terminals
       under UNIX based on the terminfo database.

       _O_p_e_n_B_y_N_a_m_e opens the terminal given  by  _d_e_v_i_c_e_n_a_m_e.   The
       device  must not be opened already.  _t_i_n_a_m_e is the name of
       the associated terminfo file.  Both names must be  0X-ter­
       minated  strings.   In  case of an empty terminfo name the
       name given by the environment variable TERM is  used.  The
       name of the device must not be an empty string.

       _U_n_i_x_T_e_r_m_i_n_a_l_s  connects  _T_e_r_m_i_n_a_l_s_._c_o_n_s_o_l_e to the control­
       ling terminal of the process, i.e. the terminal  the  user
       logged in.

       Before  exiting  the  program all opened terminals must be
       closed explicitely by the user.  As  an  alternative  _P_r_o_­
       _c_e_s_s_._T_e_r_m_i_n_a_t_e can be called.

BBUUGGSS
       Because of the architecture of UNIX, the events defined by
       _T_e_r_m_i_n_a_l_s_(_3_) are only available for the controlling termi­
       nal.
