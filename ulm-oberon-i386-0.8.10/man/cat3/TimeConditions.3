[1mNAME[0m
       TimeConditions - conditions which allow to wait for a given time

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       TYPE Condition = POINTER TO ConditionRec;
       TYPE ConditionRec = RECORD (Conditions.ConditionRec) END;
       PROCEDURE Create(VAR condition: Conditions.Condition;
                        clock: Clocks.Clock; time: Times.Time);
       PROCEDURE Init(condition: Condition; clock: Clocks.Clock; time: Times.Time);


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mTimeConditions[24m allows to specify time conditions, i.e. conditions which
       yield [1mTRUE [22mif the current time of a given clock is equal to or  past  a
       given time.

       [4mCreate[24m  creates  and  returns  [4mcondition[24m which evaluates to [1mTRUE [22mif the
       current time of [4mclock[24m is greater than or equal to [4mtime[24m.  Relative  time
       measures  are  interpreted  relative  to  the current time of the given
       clock at creation of the time condition.  Once a time condition becomes
       true for the first time, it remains true even if the clock has been set
       back afterwards.

       In case of an extended type of [4mCondition[24m, [4mInit[24m can be used  instead  of
       [4mCreate[24m.

[1mEXAMPLE[0m
       The procedure following shows how to delay the current task for a given
       number of seconds:

       PROCEDURE Delay(seconds: INTEGER);
          VAR
             time: Times.Time;
             condition: Conditions.Condition;
       BEGIN
          Times.CreateAndSet(time, Times.relative, 0, seconds, 0);
          TimeConditions.Create(condition, Clocks.system, time);
          Tasks.WaitFor(condition);
       END Delay;


[1mDIAGNOSTICS[0m
       [4mTimeConditions[24m forwards (temporarily) error events of the clock to  the
       [4merrors[24m parameter of the interface procedures of [4mConditions[24m.  Further, a
       task or process suspension is cancelled in such cases.
