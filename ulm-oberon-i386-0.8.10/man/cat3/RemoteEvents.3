       RemoteEvents - support export and import of event types

       _R_e_m_o_t_e_E_v_e_n_t_s offers the _R_e_m_o_t_e_O_b_j_e_c_t_s_(_3_) service (see _S_e_r_­
       _v_i_c_e_s_(_3_)) for event types of _E_v_e_n_t_s_(_3_).  Note  that  _R_e_m_o_­
       _t_e_E_v_e_n_t_s supports a subset of the operations of _E_v_e_n_t_s for
       event types only:

       ·      The priority of event types is initially shared but
              not maintained, i.e. priority changes do not affect
              other proxy objects or the original object.

       ·      Changes of the reaction type are not propagated  to
              other  proxy objects or the original object.  More­
              over, setting the reaction type to _E_v_e_n_t_s_._i_g_n_o_r_e or
              _E_v_e_n_t_s_._d_e_f_a_u_l_t  at  the side of the original object
              causes the support of _R_e_m_o_t_e_E_v_e_n_t_s to be  partially
              lost.   This  effect  can  be  undone only by using
              _E_v_e_n_t_s_._S_a_v_e_R_e_a_c_t_i_o_n and _E_v_e_n_t_s_._R_e_s_t_o_r_e_R_e_a_c_t_i_o_n.

       ·      _E_v_e_n_t_s_._M_a_n_a_g_e_r works locally only.

       If an event gets raised on any of the  sides  it  is  for­
       warded  (by using _P_e_r_s_i_s_t_e_n_t_E_v_e_n_t_s_(_3_)) to all other sides.
       Events types are therefore  (with  the  support  of  _R_e_m_o_­
       _t_e_E_v_e_n_t_s)  a  good technique for broadcasting events among
       all interested  parties  even  if  they  reside  in  other
       address  spaces.   Because _R_e_m_o_t_e_E_v_e_n_t_s takes advantage of
       _S_h_a_d_o_w_s_(_3_) broadcasts are distributed  in  a  parallelized
       way.

       _R_e_m_o_t_e_E_v_e_n_t_s does not generate any error events on its own
       but causes the error  events  of  _R_e_m_o_t_e_O_b_j_e_c_t_s_(_3_)  to  be
       related to the event type (see _R_e_l_a_t_e_d_E_v_e_n_t_s_(_3_)).

       _B_l_o_c_k_i_n_g_E_v_e_n_t_s_(_3_) are not supported yet  but  look  as  if
       they would be due to the hierachical definition of service
       providers (see _S_e_r_v_i_c_e_s_(_3_)).
