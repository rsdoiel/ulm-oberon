[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mArrays[24m  provides  sorted  associative  arrays  (on base of [4mAVLTrees(3)[24m)
       where objects do not need to include their key values.

       [4mCreate[24m creates an array with [4mkey[24m as sorting key.   [4mGetKey[24m  returns  the
       key previously passed to [4mCreate[24m.

       [4mSet[24m  sets  the  object  of  the array associated with [4mkeyval[24m to [4mobject[24m.
       This causes previous associations of [4mkeyval[24m, if any, to be lost.   Note
       that  [4mobject[24m  must  not  be [1mNIL[22m.  [4mGet[24m retrieves the object of the array
       associated with [4mkeyval[24m.  [1mFALSE [22mis  returned,  if  no  such  association
       exists.  [4mRemove[24m removes the association of [4mkeyval[24m within [4marray[24m, if any.
       [4mExists[24m returns [1mTRUE [22mif [4marray[24m includes an object associated with [4mkeyval[24m.
       [4mCard[24m returns the number of associations within [4marray[24m.

       [4mGetKeys[24m  returns  an  iterator  that  generates  the keys of the array,
       beginning from [4mfrom[24m up to and including [4mto[24m in sorted order.  [1mNIL [22mmay be
       given  to  designate  the  lowest  or  highest key value, respectively.
       [4mGetEntries[24m works similarly but returns the corresponding objects.

[1mDIAGNOSTICS[0m
       [4mArrays[24m does not generate error events on its own. Events by the  under-
       lying [4mAVLTrees(3)[24m implementation are forwarded to the array object.

[1mSEE ALSO[0m
       [4mAVLTrees(3)[24m     the  underlying  implementation  which  provides sorted
                       trees for objects that include  their  key  values  and
                       unique keys
       [4mSortedBags(3)[24m   sorted  trees for objects that include their key values
                       but where keys do not need to be unique
