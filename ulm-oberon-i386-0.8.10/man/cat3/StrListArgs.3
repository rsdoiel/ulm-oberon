[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mStrListArgs[24m  implements  a  list  of strings argument type for [4mArgs(3)[24m.
       Strings are represented as [4mConstStrings.String[24m and chained through [4mMem-[0m
       [4mber[24m  nodes.  The  linear list of strings is represented by a [4mValue[24m node
       where [4mhead[24m and [4mtail[24m point to  the  first  and  the  last  member  node,
       respectively.

       [4mCreate[24m iterates through all elements accessible through [4mit[24m, filters out
       objects that are extensions of [4mConstStrings.String[24m and inserts them  in
       the given order into the linear list represented by [4mvalue[24m.

       [4mArgs(3)[24m           general abstraction for arguments
       [4mConstStrings(3)[24m   constant strings of arbitrary length
