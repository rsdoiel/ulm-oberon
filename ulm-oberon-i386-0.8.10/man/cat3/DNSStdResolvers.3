[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mDNSStdResolvers[24m  provides  an implementation of [4mDNSResolvers(3)[24m that is
       based  on  [4mDNSRequests(3)[24m  and  uses  configurations  that  conform  to
       [4mresolv.conf(4)[24m.   During  its  initialization, [4mDNSResolvers.std[24m is cre-
       ated, provided it was not already initialized  by  another  implementa-
       tion.

       [4mCreate[24m   creates   a   standard  resolver  with  a  configuration  from
       [4m/etc/resolv.conf[24m which can be overridden by some environment parameters
       (see below). If this file is not present or cannot be parsed and no DNS
       cache has  been  specified  by  the  [4mDNSCACHEIP[24m  environment  variable,
       127.0.0.1 is taken as nameserver.

       [4mCreateFromConfiguration[24m  works like [4mCreate[24m but selects [4mconfiguration[24m as
       pathname of the configuration file instead of [4m/etc/resolv.conf[24m.

[1mDIAGNOSTICS[0m
       [4mDNSStdResolvers[24m makes the error events of the underlying module  [4mDNSRe-[0m
       [4mquests(3)[24m available. In addition, following error events are created:
       [4mnoRecordsFound[24m      The  domain  name  is  valid  but no records of the
                           requested type were found.
       [4mnonExistingDomain[24m   The given domain name does not exist.
       [4mtoomanyCNAMEs[24m       The chain of CNAME records was too  long.  This  is
                           possibly the cause of a reference cycle.
       [4mbadCNAME[24m            A  CNAME  record  pointed  to a non-existant domain
                           name.

[1mENVIRONMENT[0m
       [4mDNSCACHEIP[24m    If defined, overrides  the  [4mresolv.conf(4)[24m  configuration
                     and  selects  the  given  IPv4 address (in dotted decimal
                     notation) of a DNS cache as  the  only  nameserver.  This
                     environment  parameter  was first defined by Dan J. Bern-
                     stein     for     his     resolver      library,      see
                     http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/resolve.html.
       [4mLOCALDOMAIN[24m   Defines, if given, the local domain. By default, the set-
                     tings   of   ``domain''   and   ``search''   within   the
                     [4mresolv.conf(4)[24m configuration file are considered.
       [4mLOCALRES[24m      Selects, if defined, the configuration file that conforms
                     to [4mresolv.conf(4)[24m. This environment parameter was  intro-
                     duced with the [4mdig(1)[24m utility of the BIND package.

[1mFILES[0m
       [4m/etc/resolv.conf[24m   The default configuration file.

[1mSEE ALSO[0m
       [4mDNSResolvers(3)[24m       general interface for resolvers.
       [4mResolvConfParser(3)[24m   is  used  to  parse  [4mresolv.conf(4)[24m configuration
                             files.

[1mBUGS[0m
       The [4msortlist[24m directive within the [4mresolv.conf(4)[24m configuration  is  not
       supported.
