       _I_n_s_e_r_t  is  a  variant  of  _N_a_m_e_s_._I_n_s_e_r_t that chooses some
       unique name by itself and supplies it in  _n_a_m_e  for  later
       reference.

       All  error  conditions  and reactions are the same as with
       _N_a_m_e_s_(_3_), with the exception of _N_a_m_e_s_._n_a_m_e_E_x_i_s_t_s which  is
       avoided  by  definition  (in  the  worst  case  after some
       retries).
