[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mStorage[24m  provides a system-independent storage allocating interface for
       the compiler and should not be used otherwise except  as  noted  below.
       There may be different implementations for this interface, e.g. with or
       without garbage collector.

       [4mInit[24m is to be called during startup by the module which is  responsible
       for  storage  allocation (see [4mSysStorage(3)[24m).  All interface procedures
       have to follow the semantics described below.

       The variables [4mend[24m and [4mleft[24m define an interval [1m[[4m[22mend[24m[1m-[4m[22mleft[24m[1m, [4m[22mend[24m[1m) [22mwhich may
       be  consumed  by  the inline code of [1mNEW [22mand [1mSYSTEM.NEW [22mwithout calling
       any of the allocation procedures. Write  accesses  of  these  variables
       must be atomic either by using appropriate compare-and-set instructions
       of the native architecture or by blocking all  asynchronous  interrupts
       (see [4mSysSignalOperations(3)[24m).

       The  runtime start sets up an initial region which should be sufficient
       to satisfy the memory requests in the early initialization stage.   The
       module  which calls [4mInit[24m is free to modify [4mend[24m and [4mleft[24m.  For all other
       modules these variables are to be considered  read-only.   Stacks  must
       not  be  allocated  by  use of this region, and consequently coroutines
       must not be created during the early startup  phase,  i.e.  before  the
       storage allocator is initialized.

       [4mAllocateWithTag[24m  is  to  be  called  by the inline code of [1mNEW [22mand [1mSYS-[0m
       [1mTEM.NEW [22mif the interval marked by [4mend[24m and [4mleft[24m is not sufficient.  [4msize[0m
       specifies the total number of bytes needed to store the record or array
       and the tag field and, if necessary, the dummy tag.  The  type  tag  is
       specified by [4mtag[24m which may be zero in case of [1mSYSTEM.NEW[22m.  In this case
       a dummy tag record will be put behind the allocated area.  The returned
       [4mptr[24m points behind the stored type tag.

       [4mAllocateStack[24m  allocates a redzone-protected stack area for a coroutine
       with the given growing mode. Fixed  redzone-protected  regions  may  be
       requested by giving mode [1m0[22m, but [4mAllocateStack[24m does not expect that such
       a region will become a coroutine stack.  A negative value of [4mmode[24m spec-
       ifies  a  backward  growing stack.  A positive value is to be given for
       forward growing stacks.  On return, [4mptr[24m points  to  the  begin  of  the
       stack.   For  backward  growing  stacks  this is the end address of the
       allocated region.  The calling procedure or inline code is  responsible
       for adjusting [4mptr[24m and storing a tag reference to [4mCoroutines.tag[24m.

       A call of [4mGarbageCollection[24m requests an immediate run of a garbage col-
       lection. Before the  garbage  collector  is  invoked,  the  event  [4mPro-[0m
       [4mcess.startOfGarbageCollection[24m is raised, while [4mProcess.endOfGarbageCol-[0m
       [4mlection[24m signals the end of a collection.  Normally, there is no need to
       call  [4mGarbageCollection[24m,  because the storage management is responsible
       for activating the garbage collector from time to time, but every  mod-
       ule is free to do this, too.

       [4mGarbageCollection[24m  will  have  no  effect,  if there was a call of [4mDis-[0m
       [4mableCollection[24m earlier. A single call of  [4mDisableCollection[24m  guarantees
       that  the  garbage  collector is switched off. More than one calls in a
       row make it necessary that [4mEnableCollection[24m  must  be  called  as  many
       times  as  [4mDisableCollection[24m  before  to re-enable garbage collections.
       The status record component [4mcollection[24m can be interpreted as the number
       of  times  [4mEnableCollection[24m  must be called to enable a garbage collec-
       tion.  At the beginning (i.e. after the storage management is  initial-
       ized), garbage collection is enabled and [4mcollection[24m is set to [1m0[22m.

       Likewise  garbage  collections  can be suppressed if one or more corou-
       tines are in a non-tracable state (see [4mSysInterrupts(3)[24m).

       The status record component [4mintensity[24m is an indicator for  the  current
       garbage  collection  frequency.  This indicator can be interpreted as a
       clue to the amount of storage which is allowed to be  consumed  between
       two  garbage  collections.  By default, when the intensity indicator is
       set to [1m0[22m, that limit is equal to the current size of new memory chunks.
       [4mIntensity[24m  allows  to  change  the  frequency of garbage collections by
       adding [4moffset[24m to the current frequency indicator.  If [4moffset[24m  is  posi-
       tive,  the  current collection frequency is decreased, while a negative
       value increases it. Please note, that [4mIntensity(-1)[24m causes the  current
       garbage  collection frequency to be doubled and [4mIntensity(1)[24m halves it!
       [4mIntensity[24m always returns the new  frequency  indicator.  The  following
       example sets the current intensity indicator to default value [1m0[22m:

       VAR defaultFrequency: INTEGER;
       (* ... *)
       defaultFrequency := Storage.Intensity(-Storage.Intensity(0));


       [4mGetStatus[24m  returns  a  pointer  to  a record which contains information
       about the current storage status. A positive value of component [4mcollec-[0m
       [4mtion[24m  signals,  that garbage collection is currently disabled.  Garbage
       collection is enabled when [4mcollection[24m is [1m0[22m.  The current  garbage  col-
       lection  intensity  indicator  is  returned in [4mintensity[24m. The [4mchunksize[0m
       component contains the  size  of  new  memory  regions  which  will  be
       requested  from  the  operating  system when more memory is needed. The
       value returned in [4mallocated[24m represents the total number of bytes  which
       are  currently  under  control of the storage allocator, while [4mconsumed[0m
       contains  the  number  of  bytes  which  are  currently  in  use  ([4mcon-[0m
       [4msumed[24m<=[4mallocated[24m).

       [4mChunkSize[24m  allows  to  change the current chunk size. The chunk size is
       the size of new memory chunks which the storage allocator requests from
       the  system.   There may be several system-dependent requirements which
       the chunk size has to meet, such as concerning address  space  utiliza-
       tion  or  the  system's  page  size:  [4mChunkSize[24m rounds [4msize[24m to the next
       higher possible value, if the given parameter can not be  used  as  new
       chunk size (generally, it should be a good idea when [4msize[24m is a power of
       2 and greater than the page size).  As result, the  computed  value  is
       returned.   In  case  of  [4msize[24m  = [1m0[22m, [4mChunkSize[24m only returns the current
       chunk size and no change is made.
       Especially, when allocating objects with sizes greater  than  the  page
       size,  changing  the  chunk size can reduce the amount of memory needed
       from the operating system and increase  performance.   Using  [4mChunkSize[0m
       normally  effects  the current collection frequency, too, because it is
       not only dependent on the intensity indicator but  also  on  the  chunk
       size ([4mIntensity(0)[24m is performed).

       [4mFirstStack[24m  and  [4mNextStack[24m allow to examine all coroutines. This can be
       useful for debugging purposes (see [4mSysStacks(3)[24m and [4mSysStackTraces(3)[24m).

[1mDIAGNOSTICS[0m
       [4mAllocateWithTag[24m  and  [4mAllocateStack[24m  always return valid pointers which
       need not to be checked against [1mNIL[22m.  The storage allocator is responsi-
       ble  to raise the event [4moutOfMemory[24m short before it runs out of memory.
       The [4merrors[24m component of [4mStorage.Event[24m contains, if not equal to [1mNIL[22m,  a
       queue  of error events which were responsible for the ``out of memory''
       event.  The remaining memory should be sufficient to allow  some  event
       handling  and  a  controlled  termination.   The  storage  allocator is
       expected to terminate the process immediately if,  after  raising  [4mout-[0m
       [4mOfMemory[24m, the last memory resources get consumed.

       Calls to all interface procedures before [4mInit[24m lead to immediate program
       termination.

[1mBUGS[0m
       The default intensity of 0 is acceptable for very  simple  applications
       only.  Everything else that is memory-intensive should raise this value
       significantly. Otherwise these applications would  be  more  busy  with
       garbage  collection  runs  than  their  intended  purpose.  Raising the
       intensity reduces CPU time as the complexity of  a  garbage  collection
       run  depends  only  on  the amount and size of living objects. However,
       memory consumption will raise significantly for higher  intensity  val-
       ues.   The  optimal intensity value depends on the allocation behaviour
       of the application, the available virtual address space, and the avail-
       able physical memory.

       However,  as  large  intensity  values  can  lead to intensive swapping
       activities of the operating system, things can turn significantly worse
       by  rendering  the  application or in some cases even the entire system
       unresponsive. Large intensity values can also  lead  to  address  space
       problems which lead to a panic exit of [4mSysStorage(3)[24m.

       Here  are some rough estimates for the upper limits of intensity values
       in dependence of the physical memory that is available for this  appli-
       cation:

       memory   intensity
       -------------------
       1 GB     9
       800 MB   8
       600 MB   7
       400 MB   6

       Larger  values  than 9 may cause address space problems if the applica-
       tion uses a considerable number of coroutines.  This is  an  issue  for
       networked  applications  that  provide remote access to objects through
       [4mRemoteObjects(3)[24m.

       It is recommended  for  memory-intensive  applications  to  include  an
       option  for  the  command line or configuration file that allows to set
       the intensity. This has been implemented, for example, by  [4mcdbd(1)[24m  and
       [4mobload(1)[24m.
