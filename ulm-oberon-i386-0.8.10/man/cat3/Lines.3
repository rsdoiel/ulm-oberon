       _L_i_n_e_s allows  to  convert  ordinary  stream  positions  to
       line/column tuples and vice versa.  For this to work, _S_c_a_n
       must be called initially at the position which  is  to  be
       treated  as  the  beginning of the first line.  _S_c_a_n scans
       the entire stream from the current position and builds  up
       an  internal  line  table which is attached to the stream.
       All other operations lead to _s_t_r_e_a_m_N_o_t_S_c_a_n_n_e_d_Y_e_t  if  _S_c_a_n
       has  not  been  called  previously  for  the given stream.
       Please note that _S_c_a_n doesn't  rewind  the  stream.   _S_c_a_n
       should  be  called  again,  if  the  stream  contents gets
       changed, if the stream has been extended, or if  the  line
       terminator (see _S_t_r_e_a_m_D_i_s_c_i_p_l_i_n_e_s_(_3_)) has been changed.

       _S_c_a_n_n_e_d  returns TTRRUUEE if the given stream has been scanned

       yet by _L_i_n_e_s.

       _C_o_n_v_e_r_t_P_o_s takes a stream offset and converts  it  into  a
       line/column  tuple.  Please note that line numbers (compo­
       nent _l_i_n_e) and columns (component _p_o_s) are counted from 00.
       The  given stream offset must not point inside a line ter­
       minator or beyond the stream length.  _C_o_n_v_e_r_t_L_o_c  takes  a
       location and converts it into an absolute stream position.

       _L_i_n_e_s offers the operations _G_e_t_P_o_s and  _S_e_t_P_o_s  which  are
       similar to those of _S_t_r_e_a_m_s_(_3_) but take a location instead
       of an absolute stream position.

       _N_u_m_b_e_r_O_f_L_i_n_e_s returns the number of lines which have  been
       found by _S_c_a_n.

       Errors  lead  to  events  raised  by _L_i_n_e_s, _S_t_r_e_a_m_s, or an
       underlying implementation.  Following errors may be raised
       by _L_i_n_e_s:

                              was given  which  was  outside  the

                              pointed inside a line terminator or
