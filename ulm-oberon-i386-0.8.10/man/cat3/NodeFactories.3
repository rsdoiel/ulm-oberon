[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mNodeFactories[24m is an interface for persistent factory objects that allow
       to construct objects of type [4mNames.Node[24m. Factories  allow  to  separate
       the decision what kind of extension of [4mNames.Node[24m is to be created with
       which parameters from the actual creation. In the context  of  [4mNames(3)[0m
       and name services, factories allow to re-create regular nodes and links
       to other name services after a reboot of the name service.
