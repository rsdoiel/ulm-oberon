[1mNAME[0m
       PipeWriters - non-blocking write to a pipeline

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       PROCEDURE Spawn(VAR s: Streams.Stream; pipe: Streams.Stream);


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mPipeWriters[24m  provides  a  [4mStreams(3)[24m  implementation  that  accepts any
       amount of write operations without  blocking  and  buffers  the  output
       until the pipe is ready to accept it. This allows to avoid deadlocks in
       cases where a consumer would be suspended because its input is not con-
       sumed.

       This  module  preserves  the output packages as long as their size does
       not exceed the internal buffer size. [4mStreamConditions(3)[24m is  supported.

       [4mSpawn[24m creates a task that accepts without blocking all the output writ-
       ten to [4ms[24m and buffers it until [4mpipe[24m is ready to accept  it.   This  task
       will run until [4ms[24m is closed.

[1mDIAGNOSTICS[0m
       Error events are forwarded from pipe to s.

       [4mUnixPipes(3)[24m     create pipelines to other processes
