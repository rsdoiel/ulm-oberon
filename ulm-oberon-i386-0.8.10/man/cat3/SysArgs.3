       SysArgs - interface to UNIX command line arguments

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       (* $P- $O- don't trace any pointers here *)
       TYPE Argument = POINTER TO ARRAY large OF CHAR;
       TYPE Arguments = POINTER TO ARRAY large OF Argument;
       (* $P= $O= *)

       VAR environ: Arguments;


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mSysArgs[24m  is initialized by the runtime startoff and interfaces the UNIX
       command line arguments and environment parameters.

       [4margc[24m and [4menvc[24m are set to the number of arguments (including the command
       name) and the number of environment parameters.  [4margv[24m and [4menviron[24m point
       to the list of  arguments  and  environment  parameters,  respectively.
       These  pointers  may  be  modified  but  not the objects they point to.
       Oberon has no appropiate data type for  pointers  to  character  arrays
       with  unknown  length.  The problem is fixed by using pointers to array
       types with sufficient length (to avoid range check faults).   But  this
       restricts  access  to  the basic elements (i.e. characters).  Access of
       these arrays in their entirety could cause memory faults.

       Note that [4menviron[24m may be [1mNIL[22m.  The types  [4mArgument[24m  and  [4mArguments[24m  are
       protected against pointer tracing by the garbage collector.
